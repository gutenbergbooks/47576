<h2 id='chI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER I<br /><br />Bullet Proof</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Julian Epworth reasoned that his departure from
Salt Lake City was a profound secret. The fact
that an airship carrying gold was on the way to Los
Angeles convoyed by armed airplanes had been kept
inside of the office. Because of this Epworth thought
that he had an easy job.</p>

<p>“What’s the big idea about all this fancy maneuvering?”
Billy Sand inquired curiously as Epworth gave
the order to close up a little on the other nine planes
flying in a straight line ahead in military formation.
“You are acting as if there is a war on, and if we were
trying to hatch a machine gun nest.”</p>

<p>“Now that we are up in the air, and there is no
chance of a leak I will explain. The twin red and green
lights that you see ahead are on one of our airplanes
carrying a gold shipment consigned to the mint. Recently
a plane similarly loaded disappeared, and our
company lost a million dollars. We do not propose that
such a steal shall be repeated.”</p>

<p>“A million! And this crate ahead is carrying that
much?”</p>

<p>“It is carrying two million. But,” Epworth’s lips
twisted determinedly, “I do not think that an air
pirate will be able to get away with it—not as long as
these ten little babies can shoot.”</p>

<p>Julian Epworth was the head of the secret service
of the Atlantic-Pacific Airlines, Inc., and he imagined
that his plans had been extremely well laid.</p>

<p>Billy glanced up at the clear sky, picked up the
signals, and, in obedience to Epworth’s command,
closed in on the four planes flying on the left of the
large passenger ship in the lead. A ship launched
secretly into the air in the dead of night, and picked
up on the desert by an escort of ten planes, should
certainly be safe from a robber.</p>

<p>“Not a chance in a million that we will be stopped,”
he remarked thoughtfully. “Look at the moon and
the stars! We could see a plane ten miles away, and
get it long before it could get in shooting distance.”</p>

<p>Feeling in a good humor and perfectly safe, Epworth
tuned in on the radio—just loud enough to
bring the news of the world to them, and not loud
enough to give a warning to any other flyer in the
sky that might be secretly approaching.</p>

<p>Suddenly Billy leaned toward his companion excitedly,
and caught his arm.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that? I am speaking about that noise
that is coming over the radio.”</p>

<p>“Of course I heard it.”</p>

<p>The radio was saying:</p>

<p>“This is Clarence Ainslee, astronomical observer at
Mount Wilson Observatory. Are you looking at the
moon? If not, get a large telescope and look at the
extreme western extremity of the Sea of Vapours. You
will see something you never saw before. There is a
lake or sea forming there. At least that is the judgment
of astronomers.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?” Billy asked.</p>

<p>“Horse radish.”</p>

<p>Both aviators looked toward the bright shining full
moon.</p>

<p>“But,” Epworth remarked, “we could not tell anything
with our naked eyes.”</p>

<p>“In addition to the appearance of a new lake,” the
radio continued, “vegetation is appearing not far
from the eastern border of the water. The mystery of
this is now puzzling the scientific world.”</p>

<p>“Let them puzzle,” Epworth muttered as he
switched the radio dial. “I should worry.”</p>

<p>“This is the news report from the morning <i>Blade</i>,”
they heard the radio say. “Station WGCF. The report
has just come in that twenty masked men, all of whom
spoke a foreign tongue, have robbed the Swift &amp; Co.
laboratory. They lined up the seventy chemists and
their assistants, and while the gunmen held them and
their helpers the bandits looted the plant. Thousands
of dollars in liquid air, saltpeter, and chemicals were
carried off in two enormous airplanes, dim shadowy
things that stretched out two thousand feet in length.”</p>

<p>“Some little airplane. I’d like to see it!”</p>

<p>“Airplane?” Billy snorted indignantly. “They are
using dirigibles of course.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they wanted with all that
nitrogen and fertilizer?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t guess in a million years.”</p>

<p>Epworth sat up straight. He had caught a view of
two wriggling red lights ahead.</p>

<p>“There are the signals,” he cried excitedly. “Something
is going on ahead.”</p>

<p>Both aviators went into action. Epworth seized the
controls and Billy grabbed a machine gun. Both were
still thinking about the long cylinder-like airplanes
described by the radio. Epworth kept his eyes fixed
on the airship carrying the gold. A red rocket shot out
suddenly from the side of this airplane; followed by
another. These signals were answered by nine planes
that were following Epworth’s guidance through the
silent night lanes.</p>

<p>To one who did not understand, the sky looked
like a pyrotechnic display.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p>Like avenging demons the entire convoy started toward
the plane sending out the distress signals, sweeping
through the sky without lights, and their silencers
hiding their approach. But what they saw caused
every aviator and every machine gunner to pause for
a second in astonishment.</p>

<p>An immense airship, not less than two thousand
feet long, was hovering over the passenger Douglas,
guiding its movements, and twenty men were running
down a ladder that had been let down into the aviator’s
seat of the Douglas.</p>

<p>Epworth, who was leading the formation of five on
the larboard side, did not permit his astonishment to
delay action. With a jerk he seized the control,
slammed the stick into his stomach, banked slightly,
leveled out until the side of the big airship was in
line with his machine gun, and with a hoarse cry
opened a broadside at the sky pirate—for pirate he
was certain the big plane was.</p>

<p>When he fired he was not over one thousand feet
from the pirate, and it was impossible to miss. In addition
to this he had come up with a big surprise—feeling
certain that the air bandits did not know that
the treasure ship was convoyed. He expected to see
his rain of lead tear through the cowling of the
stranger and deal death and frenzy. His example was
followed by every scout plane on the larboard side.
A second later the five planes on the starboard swept
up and poured a fierce rain of lead at the stranger.
It was a barrage from both sides that it seemed would
destroy anything earthly.</p>

<p>Yet the pirate floated serenely in the air as if it had
been bombarded with peanuts, its secretly-constructed
armor turning machine bullets like pellets.</p>

<p>Epworth give the signal, and again both formations
poured their hurricane of death at the pirate. But
when this bombardment seemed to pass harmlessly
through the stranger, Epworth changed his tactics. He
aimed at four men who were climbing down the ladder
from the pirate into the Douglas. This time his shots
cut the ladder into ribbons, and the four men tumbled
down into the Douglas. Epworth, while feeling that
he had full authority to do battle, wanted to capture
the pirate and not kill the men. In this he succeeded,
as to the killing, as the four pirates fell on top of the
Douglas, or into the aviator’s seat.</p>

<p>At this moment the bandits got to fighting. Two
sheets of mysterious flames burst simultaneously from
both sides of the immense thing, and then all became
still.</p>

<p>But those two broadsides were enough. The ten
convoy airships conked, whirled over in the air, and
began to fall.</p>

<p>“Jump, Billy!” Epworth cried out loudly. “Jump!”</p>

<p>There was need. The battle was over, and the pirate
plane, with the stolen Douglas now under complete
pirate control, passed away into a dim shadow. The
twenty occupants of the destroyed convoy planes
jumped out almost at the same second, and sprang
as far away from their falling crates as possible.</p>

<p>Epworth’s umbrella opened within ten seconds.
He saw Billy shoot by like a chunk of lead. Billy was
his best chum, and his heart sank with the thought
that he would be dashed to pieces against the ground.
Frantically he leaned out. Other pilots were going
by but he managed to keep his eye on Billy. Finally
he straightened up with a cry of relief. Billy’s parachute
was spreading.</p>

<p>“Safe,” he cried, “but great heavens what a battle!
That plane’s sides are bullet proof, and it rides the
sky as if it owned it.”</p>

<p>He looked upward. All he could see above his head
were the stars. These were blotted out by the rapid
approach of the earth, and the peak of the high mountain
passing by him.</p>

<p>He landed safely but what would the president of
the Air Company say when he returned with this terrible
and unexpected disaster to report?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER II<br /><br />The Stowaway</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">They were seated in the living room of President
Epworth’s palatial residence in Hollywood. While
the conversation was in a low tone and seemingly
calm there was an air of tenseness that got on the
nerves of the speakers.</p>

<p>“So you suggest——”</p>

<p>President Epworth paused, and looked interrogatingly
at his nephew, Julian Epworth.</p>

<p>“That we send out a dummy on an alleged trip to
Japan, start it secretly but with sufficient tips to permit
the knowledge of its departure to circulate. With it
send a small shipment of money. Let Billy Sand pilot
the dummy, and I will follow in a swift scout plane
equipped to cross the Pacific. If the sky bandits attack,
Billy is to be instructed to offer no resistance,
and I will lag behind and follow the robbers to their
lair. When I return we will fall on that bunch with
the entire United States army. Believe me I do not
speak loosely when I say that the army will be necessary.
Those bandits have the best fighting air vessel
invented. They are far ahead of anything I have ever
heard of in the way of air pirates.”</p>

<p>“And that dummy should carry——”</p>

<p>“Enough gold to relieve it of the suspicion that it
is a plant.”</p>

<p>The president tapped the table with his fingers.</p>

<p>“Our company cannot afford to lose any money.”</p>

<p>“My idea is to make the cargo large enough to pay
a profit if it goes across but not large enough to create a
great loss. If the bandits come I have a hunch that they
will be connected with the men who robbed Swift
&amp; Co., Ford, Dupont, and others. If I can trace them
to their lair we stand a chance to get all that back.”</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the fact that you are my nephew,
Julian, I placed you at the head of our secret service
because I knew that you had ability in spite of your
youthfulness. I am now putting a grave responsibility
on you. We cannot do business while a bunch of hijackers
are running the air lanes, and stealing everything
valuable we send out. We must stop business or
catch the thieves. The first thing we know they will be
dropping bombs on our airports. I am going to put
this matter up to you.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I mean that you have the responsibility of catching
these men. I am turning the matter entirely over
to you for action.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I accept the charge.”</p>

<p>As a result of this conversation Epworth concluded
to send out the Greyhound, a large 12-passenger
Douglas—old but a good flyer. Billy Sand was named
as the pilot and entire crew. After studying weather
conditions closely it was decided to make the start the
following Thursday night.</p>

<p>So secret was Epworth in his method that he planted
his small H.B. in an open space near Hines Field, six
miles from the airport of the Atlantic-Pacific Company,
and the only person he took completely into
his confidence was Billy Sand, his aviation buddy and
chum. Billy did not even let Bert Orme know that
Epworth was to follow them. To Orme it looked as if
an honest-to-goodness flight was being made across the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Billy was instructed to show constantly by night
three red lights, one on each wing, and one on the
tail of the Greyhound. These lights were to be turned
on every night at sundown during the entire trip. In
addition to this Epworth decided to fly the pursuit by
himself.</p>

<p>At eleven forty-five the young man moved his plane
from its hiding place, and mounted into the air. He
chuckled as he took the air. His sister, Joan, was the
only living person who knew where this plane had
been hidden and he felt certain that it could not have
been “doctored,” although he had been late in getting
to it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for his purpose the night was dark
and a heavy fog had come up from the ocean about ten
o’clock, and for ten minutes he feared that the fog
banking against the windows of his cockpits would
prevent observation. With a snort of dismay he threw
open the window, and leaned out. The great City of
Los Angeles, with its myriads of beautiful lights spread
beneath, and he lost three minutes locating the five-pointed
lights that marked the Atlantic-Pacific airport.
He was flying low, circling like an eagle, and he
lost several seconds more getting to the airport.</p>

<p>Had he arrived too late?</p>

<p>He anathematized himself, and snarled at the darkness
that had caused him to be late in getting to his
plane. Billy, by this time, was probably on his way.</p>

<p>He searched the sky with his binoculars. The three
red lights the Greyhound was to display were not
visible. Was it possible that his secret plans had already
come to naught? Would Billy fly out over the ocean
and rush into the hands of the pirates without accomplishing
any good?</p>

<p>For a moment he had a spell of very bad humor;
then he whirled the nose of his plane out toward the
Pacific Ocean. He knew the course the Greyhound
would travel. He had been careful with his instructions
to Billy about getting into the air and these instructions
conveyed to Billy the idea that he was to
give no heed to the little plane that followed him.
This meant that Billy would take a direct bee line
out over the ocean, and expect him to follow as if
there was to be an ordinary oceanic flight.</p>

<p>Rising two thousand feet, he shot forward with all
the speed his wonderfully fast little bird could
travel—three hundred miles an hour. In a brief slip of time
he was over San Pedro, and could hear the roar of
the ocean sweeping against the rocks north of Point
Firmin. Bearing N by W he flashed over the extreme
end of Catalina Island on the north. Still the dense
fog rolled against his windows and into the cabin; and
the three red Greyhound lights were not visible.</p>

<p>He groaned in an agony of spirit. What would his
Uncle William say to this terrible waste of money and
inefficiency?</p>

<p>“And what will Joan say?” he asked himself aloud
in a strained hurt way. “She also will think that I’m
a slip-up.”</p>

<p>“She will say that you have a very fast little airplane,
that you can fly circles around the Greyhound, and
that now is the time to fly them.” A soft, mellow voice
answered his query from the rear end of the cabin.
“Fly low, say one thousand feet above the water, and
keep your eyes glued to your field glasses. Joan
will watch for you while you manipulate the
controls.”</p>

<p>A handsome, well-formed and athletic young girl,
about eighteen years old, crawled out of the tail of
the fuselage, and dropped into the aviator’s seat by
his side.</p>

<p>“H-how did you get here?” Epworth blustered.
“What do you mean by butting in on a dangerous
mission like this? How did you find out that I was
going to make this trip? Now I will have to turn
around and take you back. If you were not my sister
I’d slam you overboard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you wouldn’t throw me overboard. If you
did that you wouldn’t have a little sister to fuss about.
As to all those other questions—come at me easy. Put
them one at a time. But before you begin to propound
them get into some kind of action. Go down a thousand
feet. You are too high in the air.”</p>

<p>This was good sense, and Epworth nose-dived immediately.
When he straightened out on the thousand
foot line he leveled his nose northward into a
vast encircling movement.</p>

<p>“You needn’t go any further north,” Joan remarked
casually. “I see your three little old red lights out toward
the west.”</p>

<p>Epworth heaved a sigh of relief; and then turned
angrily on his sister.</p>

<p>“Now talk up. You have balled things up terribly.
When daylight comes I will have to signal Billy to
go back so that I can take you back home. You are
set for college, young lady, and it is nearing the opening
of the year.”</p>

<p>“I am not going back. My brother is out here on a
life and death mission, my uncle stands to go broke if
this mission fails, and I’m going to help. Get that,
Mister Bossy.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t go, Joan. This task may take me to
the North Pole, or to some island in the South Pacific,
or to Siam.”</p>

<p>“I am going with you or I am going to jump over
the side of this plane into the ocean.”</p>

<p>There was a finality about her words that carried
conviction. That was Joan all over. She was very quiet,
very self-possessed, very polite, but she was like the
Rock of Gibraltar when she made up her mind.</p>

<p>Epworth did not reply. Now that he was actually
following the Greyhound he did not want to desert his
task. He pushed nearer to the three red lights. Billy
was purposely running with his cut-outs open, and
he could hear the roar of the Greyhound’s engines.
This was another evidence that he was trailing the
right airplane. At this time all other planes that sailed
the air were as silent as birds.</p>

<p>“Now let me hear how you got on to this job?”</p>

<p>“You talk too much,” Joan rebuked severely. “I
heard you talking to Billy last night when he came up
to the house.”</p>

<p>“Then if you know about it I guess the bandits
know something about it also,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>Joan did not answer, and for an hour Epworth ran
to the starboard of the Greyhound, and several hundred
feet higher.</p>

<p>“There is a shadow hanging over the Greyhound,”
Joan observed presently. “Is it a cloud?”</p>

<p>“So soon!” Epworth exclaimed in astonishment.
“Those robbers are certainly wise ones, and the leak
out of the Atlantic-Pacific Airlines must be as big
as a river.”</p>

<p>“I do not seem to get you,” Joan replied slangily.
She had been associating so much with aviators and air
men that she had become one. “Spring a little larger
leak in your gas line.”</p>

<p>“You are now going to view the methods of the
sky bandits,” he said slowly, handing her his binoculars.
“Keep your eyes fixed on that shadow, and I
will manipulate the plane nearer so that you will be
certain.”</p>

<p>Within three minutes they were close enough to see
a sky hold-up. A long cylinder, tremendously long it
seemed to her as she viewed it through the fog, swung
gracefully and easily into position over the Greyhound,
and for several moments ran along smoothly
as if it were a part of the lower airship. Then a trap
door opened in the bottom of the cylinder, a rope
fell into the aviator’s seat of the Greyhound, and ten
men descended quickly. For several seconds the ladder
swung to and fro over the Greyhound but when a signal
whistle, sharp and clear, rang out from the aviator’s
seat of the Greyhound, the great cylinder whirled with
lightning speed and darted away directly north. It
was swallowed up so quickly in the fog that Joan could
only stare at it with open-mouthed surprise.</p>

<p>When she thought to look back at the Greyhound
the captured vessel had swung into the course of the
cylinder.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to follow that thing,” she whispered
in awe. “Why it flies—it flies—like—like——”</p>

<p>“A ball out of a cannon,” Epworth finished. “But
fortunately I did not contemplate following it. We
will follow the Greyhound. I knew before we started
out on this trip that those cylinders could gain a speed
of six hundred miles an hour, and my plot was to get
them to capture the Greyhound, and follow it. They
have fallen into the plot, and now a sky bandit, and
not Billy, is piloting the plane.”</p>

<p>With a careful movement he dropped in behind
the Greyhound, and climbed up over it. But presently
he discovered that he would have to go higher. The
Greyhound was gradually seeking altitude in a long
upward nose sweep. This movement was continued
until an altitude of five thousand feet had been attained.
At this altitude the Greyhound leveled out,
put on more speed, and darted courageously toward
the frozen North. Epworth followed, easily keeping
the three red lights in view although the cut-out of the
Greyhound was now closed.</p>

<p>“Six hundred miles an hour!” Joan’s voice contained
an element of doubt. “How could they attain
such a speed? There is no known force that will pull
them that fast.”</p>

<p>“Goddard’s liquid rockets,” Epworth answered
briefly. “I was studying their explosion when the hold-up
was taking place. They have a soft, low, whirling
explosion but these men have gone the scientist one
better. They have found a method of silencing the
explosions and still retaining all the force.”</p>

<p>“My, I wonder where they are taking the Greyhound?”</p>

<p>“We are following them to find out.”</p>

<p>“I am still wondering how the cylinders can give
such speed.”</p>

<p>“The rockets are propelled by the steady combustion
of carbon in liquid oxygen.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea that they must be taking the Greyhound
a long distance from home.”</p>

<p>They were.</p>

<p>Four days later Epworth and his sister, Joan, were
still following the stolen airship—and were flying over
an unknown portion of the Arctic Ocean. Below them
there was a vast sea of ice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER III<br /><br />An Arctic Blizzard</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">On and on, over pale gray wastes, above fleecy
clouds and heavy fogs; high up over tossing
waters, and floating mountains of ice—not a stop for
fuel, with engines silenced until they flew like bats
in the night, the Greyhound leading the way, and Epworth
sticking to it like a dark, hungry shadow with
his ship lines camouflaged by sky blue paint, and his
eyes ever vigilant.</p>

<p>How Billy managed to keep the three red lights
going notwithstanding the fact that he was a captive
was a mystery that Epworth did not attempt to solve. It
was being done, and Epworth was contented to follow.</p>

<p>At last Northeastern Siberia, and a mysterious range
of mountains. Epworth, taking his position, knew
them for the Cherski Mountains, recently discovered
and completely unexplored—a barren, cold, lifeless
region bordering on the Arctic Ocean a thousand
miles from the outmost limits.</p>

<p>How long would this journey last? Where would
the Greyhound lead? Had the sky bandits discovered
that they were being followed, and were they leading
him into a death trap amid a vast wilderness of ice?</p>

<p>He examined his gas supply. Joan looked at him
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Just about enough to take us back to Point Hope.”</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the cowling of the little machine
fearfully.</p>

<p>“Shall we go back?”</p>

<p>She pointed at the Greyhound.</p>

<p>“Billy is in that ship,” she replied softly. “We cannot
leave him. His liberty, and very likely his life, depend
upon our actions.”</p>

<p>He put his hand affectionately on her shoulder—just
like a chum. Few brothers loved their sisters as
Epworth loved Joan.</p>

<p>“You are the bravest, squarest girl in the world. I
knew you would say it. But——”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“We will have to depend upon stealing enough gas
from the tank of the Greyhound to get back,” she
added smilingly.</p>

<p>Now the Greyhound turned abruptly westward, and
followed the Cherski Mountains, lowering its altitude
to five hundred feet above the highest peak. Epworth
followed persistently, keeping a higher altitude.</p>

<p>“Small wonder,” Joan remarked as she watched the
shadow of the Greyhound flit swiftly over the face
of the white-capped ridges, “that the governments
could not locate them. With their swift airplanes they
dart down on the commerce of the world like Omar
on a desert caravan, and are back in their hidden North
Pole lair before the robbery is known by the authorities.
Where are we?”</p>

<p>“Eight hundred miles north by west of Bogosloff
Island, perhaps a thousand miles.”</p>

<p>“So far,” Joan observed patiently, “we have had
unusually even weather. Now we are going to have an
Arctic blizzard.”</p>

<p>She pointed north over the long reach of ocean that
came up to lash the mountains beneath them. Epworth
shivered. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>“We have a mighty staunch little airship.”</p>

<p>She did not answer for several moments. Would
these bandits go on forever? Was there no hole anywhere
for them to hide in?</p>

<p>“The Greyhound has disappeared,” Joan suddenly
broke out excitedly. “I saw it just a moment ago behind
that distant peak.”</p>

<p>Epworth glanced out of the window. A sudden
sheet of frozen snow and a rain of heavy chunks of
ice struck the window. It came with terrific fury, unexpected.
However, he had adjusted the stabilizer,
and notwithstanding the fact that the little ship was
tossed up and down like a feather and went lop-sided
for a second it weathered the furious burst, and
staggered on like a wounded bird.</p>

<p>Epworth gave one more look for the Greyhound.
Not a thing was now visible—not even the rugged
snow mountains below. With a grave face he banked
and faced the storm, putting on every ounce of power
the engine would carry. The little plane stood still,
poised like an eagle, with the bronzed shadow of its
wings dipped in the immensity of gray storm and
whirling, shrieking wind.</p>

<p>On the windows of his ship the rubber vacuum
wipers stopped, choked immovable by lumps of ice
hurled against the glazed surface. To see out was impossible—he
was shooting through darkness, a
howling, shrieking, terrifying murk created by storm.
He glanced at Joan. She smiled at him to cheer him,
but it was a courageous effort to conquer a mighty
fear.</p>

<p>He must see out. If they moved forward in the direction
they were headed they would be forced out
over the ocean, away from the sky bandits’ retreat.
That camp was somewhere in this range of mountains.
He had a hunch that it was not far away. If he
succeeded in his mission he must keep the mountains
in view and make a search when the frenzy of the
storm had passed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he moved with slow deliberation. He
pasted a small strip of inch-thick Balsa wood beneath
the wipers on the window, lighted two candles and
stuck them on the Balsa shelf thus made. It was
dangerous—deadly dangerous. If the storm shot a flash
of that blaze into the gas tank the end would be instantaneous.
He smiled grimly, and nodded at his
sister. The girl bowed her head in acquiescence. She
also realized the danger of a flame of fire at this time.</p>

<p>The heat of the candles warmed the window and
the wipers began to move, clearing the space for
visibility.</p>

<p>His observations were useless. All he could see was
a world of whirling snow and ice.</p>

<p>He sought altitude. But the higher he ascended the
fiercer grew the storm. Then he nosed down slowly
until he stood a thousand feet above the highest mountain.
Then he slowed his engines and allowed the
storm to push him backwards. He was seeking the
neighborhood where he had last seen the Greyhound.</p>

<p>Again he turned his eyes on Joan. She was taking
the battle like a Trojan.</p>

<p>“You are very brave,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“And the boy with me is not a coward,” she replied
softly.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, and there was not a tremble
in it.</p>

<p>“I have lost our reckoning, but——”</p>

<p>The sentence was not completed. The tempest increased
with irresistible fury, and shot them down
obliquely, catching the starboard wing, and with
weird, demoniacal power whirled the plane over and
over in a rush of air that the propellers were unable
to stop.</p>

<p>Joan was hurled into Epworth’s arms, and both
were tossed up and down in their seats, and against
the light cowling. Each second they expected to be
hurled out of the cabin. In order to lessen the danger
Epworth shut off the engine. At least there would be
no fire.</p>

<p>“We must jump,” he explained briefly. “The plane
is whirling over and over and will strike a peak soon.”</p>

<p>“Small chance for an umbrella in a storm like this,”
Joan returned quite calmly. “It will be whipped into
strips.”</p>

<p>“Yet the parachute is our only hope.”</p>

<p>He hooked the package around her shoulders and
adjusted it carefully. Then he put one around his own
shoulders, and handed her a package that he took from
a pocket in the fuselage.</p>

<p>“Some useful articles, and a little food and water,”
he informed her. “May come in useful. We can’t tell
what is ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Good bye, sister.”</p>

<p>“Good bye, brother.”</p>

<p>They smiled at each other, and jumped.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chIV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />A Flashing Cylinder</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Joan was caught in the mighty whirl of the blizzard,
her parachute opened with a spurt, and she was
jerked back and forth like a feather while large chunks
of ice shot against her face with sufficient force to
lacerate the skin. She was a brave girl but now a great
fear overpowered her, and she sent out a wild cry of
terror.</p>

<p>Her scream reached the ears of her brother over
the howling storm, and his heart went dead. What
was happening to Joan? Would it be possible that she
could still have a thread of her parachute left, and
that the wind was ripping it apart?</p>

<p>With feverish eyes he sought in every direction. He
could not see her. Then he realized how puerile his
thoughts were. If he chanced to see her there was
nothing that he could do to aid her.</p>

<p>Both parachutes had been made to stand up against
hard storms, and they held notwithstanding the fact
that they were whirled over and over in the rushing
air.</p>

<p>After that one wild shout of fear Epworth heard
nothing more from Joan, and now his own danger
was such that he had little time to worry about her. He
had to give his own chute all his mind. Drifting
swiftly he was held up by the wind that got under
his parachute. Frequently the umbrella tilted and he
thought that it would turn inside out but his weight
held it down in proper shape, and he raced onward.
Suddenly a mountain of snow and ice shot up in front
of him. He was on the peak so quickly that he had
little time to think or act. Would he be slammed
against a jagged rock by the terrible wind, and his
head smashed, or would he be dropped into a deep
crevasse from which there would be no possible escape—a
place where he would freeze quickly or else
starve?</p>

<p>He was blown over the summit with a scarce twenty
feet to spare, and felt himself falling. He had not
fallen far before he discovered that the mountain
sheered off at this point with a deep precipitous cliff.
This cliff shut off the wind, and he began to fall slowly.
Looking down he saw no bottom. He was still in
the air.</p>

<p>A sudden gust of wind, a wild shriek and something
bumped against him. Before he realized what was taking
place a pair of arms passed around his waist, and
clutched him spasmodically. He recovered his surprise
instantly, and in turn threw his arms around Joan
in order that they should not be separated. The two
parachutes had bumped together in an eddy, and now
the ropes were entangled so that they could not separate
if they desired. With a gentle hand he pulled the
girl up to his level.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” she said calmly, when she discovered
the situation, “we will die together. It is
best.”</p>

<p>She was cold, wet, frightened, but was taking her
medicine like a soldier.</p>

<p>When he looked around the blizzard seemed to be
losing its force. He understood the reason. They had
been blown over the top of the mountains and were
falling on the opposite side, and the mountains shut
off the wind. As they fell steadily and their parachutes
became more stable he realized that so far as the storm
was concerned they were safe.</p>

<p>But what would they fall into? He could not look
down and see but presently they slipped into a deep
recess in the mountains, and the noise of the blizzard
slackened materially, and they began to descend
faster. Epworth felt as if he wanted to guide the things
that were holding them up to a soft spot—if there was
such a thing in this wild, terrible country—but he was
helpless. All he could do was to hold his sister, and
look wild-eyed in all directions.</p>

<p>They were laced together beyond separation, and
this gave him comfort. They would land together;
they would meet the same fate; and perhaps he might
be able to save her from death after all.</p>

<p>Now he looked toward the north, and saw some
mountains free from snow. How could this be in this
land of perpetual ice? He glanced down, and discovered
that they were falling into a valley several
miles long protected by four immense peaks. As they
descended lower the air became milder, the intense
cold, which almost froze his face, decreased perceptibly,
and the wind stopped entirely.</p>

<p>Looking upward he saw the blizzard covering the
sky with a sheet of snow; looking down he saw green
spruce trees, and a stretch of sand.</p>

<p>“Snap into it, Joan!” he exclaimed cheerfully, sweet
hope springing up in his heart. “We are going to
make a safe landing.”</p>

<p>Joan opened her eyes and shivered.</p>

<p>“A-a-are—we—dead?” she gasped. “This is too awful
for life.”</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked around, and when
she saw the rugged mountains she blanched, but made
no comment. He caught her suddenly in his arms and
lifted her above his head.</p>

<p>“W-w-what are you doing?” she whispered faintly.
“Let me——”</p>

<p>They landed on a stretch of soft sand before she
finished her remark, and he ran with her for a few
steps and stopped. Then, still holding her, he cut
the cords that bound them to the two parachutes.
Relieved of their burden the parachutes tumbled
away and disappeared.</p>

<p>When they were able to stand steadily they discovered
that they had stopped just in time to keep
from going over and down another steep precipice.</p>

<p>“I see,” Joan grumbled, “trying to keep me from
being hurt. I will have you know, Mister Man, that
I take my share of all the dangers.”</p>

<p>Epworth did not answer. He was looking down into
a deep valley alive with men, women and children—a
valley heated by slow, spluttering volcanic fires that
came up out of the earth. While he was still staring
there came a muffled explosion, a humming noise,
and there flashed into the sky a streak of bright
aluminum. It shot upward with such swiftness that
it was barely visible for a fraction of a second, leaving
behind a somewhat lurid trail that hung in the air
for a second and then disappeared.</p>

<p>“W-w-what was it?” Joan gasped.</p>

<p>Epworth gave no heed to the question. He was staring,
open-mouthed at the spot where the cylinder
came from. He was still staring when it seemed to
him that the earth opened, and another flash of
aluminum shot into the sky, followed by a muffled
explosion.</p>

<p>“W-what the Sam Hill?”</p>

<p>Epworth could get no farther. His astonishment
choked him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER V<br /><br />Down into the Den</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Joan shook her glossy hair as Epworth sat up and
looked around, and twisted her eyebrows in a
puzzled way.</p>

<p>“It came out of that round black tube buried in
earth at the far side of the valley; or, perhaps, it was
one of the mysterious flying machines that the newspapers
talked about—like the one that captured the
Greyhound. You can readily see that this is the lair
of the sky bandits. There is the Greyhound.”</p>

<p>Epworth drew out his powerful field glasses. He
never failed to carry them with him. In fact, he had
become so accustomed to searching the earth for miles
around as he flew over it that it had become as much
of a habit to carry binoculars as it was to wear his
nose. His observations corroborated Joan’s statement
concerning the Greyhound. In addition to that plane
he saw a number of other machines that belonged to
the Atlantic-Pacific Airlines, Inc., and bags of saltpeter
piled indiscriminately around a large warehouse
made of corrugated iron.</p>

<p>But there were no indications of idleness in the
camp. Even the women and children were doing some
kind of work, and the men—more than a thousand of
them—were rushing pell mell hither and yon, gathering
up large quantities of stuff, pushing it into containers,
and piling the containers systematically into
cylinders at least two thousand feet long.</p>

<p>“No, it was not an airship. It was one of those long
aluminum cylinders that are being loaded by the
men at work. It was shot up into the air by some kind
of machinery. But why do they do it, and where is the
machinery?”</p>

<p>“In that hole in the ground,” Joan explained, as
she glanced through the binoculars. “There seems to
be a round pit over there.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are going down there and find out what
it all means. Very likely the crews of all the airships
stolen are down there. I am quite sure that Billy Sand
is there.”</p>

<p>“Going to walk right in, turn right around, and
walk right out with all the airships and the rescued
crews?”</p>

<p>Her tone was quite sarcastic.</p>

<p>“I hardly think that we will work that fast but if
we are not able to sneak into that place and get the
Greyhound there is very little hope of ever returning
to dear old Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p>“There are forty of the new-style airships,” she
pointed out, “and it would be easy for them to overtake
the Greyhound.”</p>

<p>“We will have to risk something. We will never——”</p>

<p>He was stopped by a giant cylinder being catapulted
out of one of the dark tubes, and flashing away into
space. They stood staring for fifteen minutes, and
another cylinder followed. Then the hum of the machinery
quieted down. Epworth drew out his watch.
“It has been just ninety minutes since the first cylinder
was fired,” he asserted. “The second the cylinder
goes into space the men below get awful busy loading
another. They are—yes, I really believe that they are
systematically shooting something into space.”</p>

<p>“Are they crazy?” Joan looked around apprehensively.
“I would rather run into a nest of robbers than
a camp of crazy people.”</p>

<p>“We will try to get down there, and get away without
being seen. Around the side of the cliff I see a
place where it will be possible to slip down without
hurting ourselves, although it is steep.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of things down there,” his
sister objected. “Look at that ugly giant!”</p>

<p>She gave Epworth the field glasses, and pointed to
a certain man. He was a great giant, long-bearded,
hairy, and powerful. He was viciously whipping a
smaller man while four men held the small man a
prisoner with his face to the wall of a big corrugated
iron building.</p>

<p>“Slave drivers,” Epworth observed sharply, his
mouth twitching angrily. “I wonder if the little fellow
can be Billy?”</p>

<p>Joan shuddered. She was thinking of the gallant
young aviator flying away into the night to give himself
voluntarily into captivity for the sake of the men
who employed him—a captivity that at present looked
as if it was the most vicious of all tyranny.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get away, and send help,” she whispered
fiercely. “This racket must be cleaned out if it
takes the entire United States army.”</p>

<p>“The United States army cannot come into this
country. It is foreign soil. The easiest thing to do is
to steal the plane.”</p>

<p>“I’ll venture there are a thousand eyes watching it.”</p>

<p>“You’d throw cold water on a fish,” Epworth
grumbled. “But just the same we shall make the attempt.”</p>

<p>At this moment a door in one of the large corrugated
iron buildings opened, an enormous cylinder
was rolled out, twenty men got aboard, and it shot
up into the air with incredible rapidity.</p>

<p>“How would the Greyhound get away from an airship
like that?”</p>

<p>Joan’s eyes fastened on the disappearing ship with
intense fascination.</p>

<p>“I do not see any propellers,” she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It is a rocket plane, I previously described, the latest
improvement on the German idea of shooting an
airship forward with liquid rockets. However, let’s
be moving.”</p>

<p>They ate from the lunch boxes that Epworth had
hastily snatched up when they jumped into the air,
and with stealthy steps descended the steep incline,
hiding frequently behind the large boulders on the
hillside. Fortunately the men in the valley, or rather
huge crater—for it was patent that it had one time
been a volcano and the fires were only now simmering
in spots—were busy and did not see them, and they
finally got safely behind the large hangar that protected
twenty or more of the big airships. Inside of
the building the men at work were talking in a strange
language but when Epworth peeped around the corner
he discovered the coast to the Greyhound seemed clear.</p>

<p>Slipping from behind the hangar they darted across
the open space, and gained the protection of another
building without being seen. Repeating this maneuver
several times they finally came up to several of the
American planes. But they had been purposely battered.
A wing had been destroyed, an engine had
been put out of running, the propeller had been
broken, or the fuselage and rudders shot to pieces.
The Greyhound had not been in camp long, and
seemed to be in working condition. They centered
their attention on it.</p>

<p>First Epworth surveyed the field. The crater pit
was swarming with men, and weaving in between them
were hundreds of women and children. Obviously it
was some kind of a colony, and Epworth caught himself
wondering what all these people meant by coming
this far from civilization to live.</p>

<p>Some distance away the young man saw a body of
American aviators. They were shoveling saltpeter into
an enormous vat, and were being herded around by
heavily armed guards. Frequently a heavy whip was
used on the back of a prisoner to expedite his movements.</p>

<p>When Epworth saw this he realized that it would
not be long before the Greyhound would be dismantled.
The pirates did not intend to give the prisoners
a chance to escape.</p>

<p>Again he gave the Greyhound a careful study. It
was guarded by four men who were seated on a boulder
on the side of the mountain opposite from his possible
approach. He and Joan would have to get to the
Greyhound, get in it, rev up, and get away with a
swiftness that was almost an impossibility.</p>

<p>Still it was their only chance. He would make a
stagger at gaining his liberty. If they remained in this
crater it would be only a matter of a short time before
they would be discovered.</p>

<p>To make the break Joan must go also, and it would
be hard to slip into the plane without one of them
being seen.</p>

<p>“Concealment is useless,” he asserted. “We must
run for it. When you get there jump in, and if we are
attacked I will try to hold them off while you start
the engine.”</p>

<p>Fleet as swallows the two darted forward. Epworth,
an all-round athlete, timed his speed to keep even
with the girl. They got to the door, Joan’s hand was
on it, when the four guards ran around the plane, gave
a shout and closed in on them.</p>

<p>“Jump in!” Epworth urged. “Snap at it. I will hold
them.”</p>

<p>He whirled like a lion, dodged, and caught the leading
guard a heavy blow in the stomach. The man
doubled up with a grunt, and Epworth, foot-working
swiftly and dodging with the expertness of a prize
fighter, evaded a rush by two men, and caught the
fourth a right hand body blow on the run. His victim
toppled over sideways.</p>

<p>Not for a second did he pause. He was fighting for
life. These men were unscrupulous robbers. He knew
this by the way in which they destroyed airplanes.
They would not hesitate to slug him, and make Joan’s
future life miserable.</p>

<p>Wheeling fiercely he flung himself on the other two
men. This time he made a football rush, jerked a
man’s legs from under him, and crashed his head
against the ground. Before the other man could catch
him he bounded to his feet, and struck him a vicious
blow under the chin. The man toppled like a tenpin.</p>

<p>All this time the man he had punched in the stomach
was doubled up groaning. Now he lifted his head,
and straightened up. But before he could advance
Epworth bounced forward, leaped into the open door
of the Greyhound, and dropped into the aviator’s
seat, panting from his violent exertion.</p>

<p>The next second the Greyhound was spluttering
loudly and taxying across the rocky ground. If the
engine would pick up a little safety was in sight.</p>

<p>It did. After popping loudly for several seconds it
purred down and the Greyhound lifted its wheels
from the ground.</p>

<p>At this moment a huge giant stepped out of the
most pretentious house in the place. In his hand he
held a light machine gun. Leveling it at the Greyhound
he began to shoot. There were three propellers,
and one by one, with uncanny aim, the giant disabled
the blades and just as escape seemed at hand the airship
staggered, slumped like a wounded bird, and
struck the ground with powerful impact.</p>

<p>Joan, seeing inevitable fall, braced herself with her
feet, and escaped with a slight jar.</p>

<p>Epworth, in a vain attempt to lift the nose of the
ship upward, was hurled against the cowling with a
force that knocked him unconscious.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />A Dangerous Scientist</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Julian Epworth returned to consciousness on a
luxurious day bed in a pleasant plastered room
tinted a light green. For several moments he did not
comprehend. Presently he put his hand up to his
head, and found a bandage.</p>

<p>“Just what happened?” he asked curiously, not expecting
a reply.</p>

<p>“Take it calmly,” Joan advised. She was sitting by
him in a dejected attitude. “We’re prisoners, and——”</p>

<p>“Where are we?” he demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>She placed her finger on her lips, and pointed at
an open door. The only thing the young man could
see through the door was another plastered room
tinted blue, and a radio receiving set.</p>

<p>“This is KFI, Los Angeles, California,” he heard
come over the radio. “We are now going to hear from
Professor Ainslee, the distinguished astronomer of
Mount Wilson Observatory. He is going to tell you
something about the things that are going on in the
moon.”</p>

<p>There was a brief delay, and then Prof. Ainslee’s
well-known voice came over the air.</p>

<p>“Greetings, ladies and gentlemen of Radio Land:
Continuing my short talks about the marvelous
growth on our satellite, I will state that the newly
discovered lake in the extreme western part of the
Sea of Vapours is rapidly getting larger. I should say
that it is about a mile in diameter at this time. Of
course it cannot be water as water cannot exist on the
moon. The heat of the sun, shining steadily for fourteen
days, would dry it up as there is no air on the
moon to give the water protection. As all readers are
aware air forms a blanket over water, and prevents
its gradual evaporation. But there is certainly a dark
spot at the point indicated, and the scientific world
is studying it thoughtfully. The spectroscopic investigation
states absolutely that it is water. This increases
the mystery.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha,” a shrill voice broke out in the adjoining
room, “I, the greatest and mightiest scientist in the
world, am the only man who can answer this mystery.
Bring in the prisoners, Kosloff, and let them hear
the rest of this astronomical lecture. Perhaps they may
be interested to discover how ignorant their scientists
are.”</p>

<p>The speaker had hardly finished when the door was
pushed open, and four men sprang into the green-tinted
room, covering Epworth and Joan with their
guns.</p>

<p>“Come,” one of the men commanded in broken
English, “the general wishes to speak to you.”</p>

<p>Epworth got up from the bed, and followed by
Joan passed through the door guarded by the gunmen.
Their captors stopped them in front of a large
mahogany desk. Seated behind this desk was an enormous
giant. Epworth instantly recognized him as the
man who had prevented the get-away in the Greyhound
with a machine gun.</p>

<p>The giant stood up and made an elaborate bow,
drawing his immense height erect. He was fully eight
feet tall, and extended an arm almost as large as Joan’s
body. Epworth weighed 160 pounds, and mentally
compared his weight with the appearance of the giant.
He was willing to wager that the giant would weigh
350 pounds, and that there was not an ounce of surplus
fat about the man’s red-haired body. He thought
of red hair all over the man because the giant’s shirt
was open at the throat and a huge mat of red hair was
visible. In addition to this he had a mass of tousled
red hair on his head and a long red beard, which came
almost to his waist. He was, in fact, a Man Mountain
Dean, beard and all.</p>

<p>He smiled at Epworth and Joan, and they thought
of horse teeth, and the nose of Cyrano de Bergerac.</p>

<p>As Joan stepped in front of him he leaned forward,
and gave her a hard stare out of his small, twinkling
pale blue eyes. At first there was a slight pucker of
puzzlement around his big mouth. Then he spoke in
good English in a small shrill voice. His voice was so
small and sharp that it was all Joan could do to keep
from laughing. Epworth saw that she was about to
smile, and punched her lightly in the side, shaking his
head vigorously in the negative.</p>

<p>“It will never do to laugh at him,” he whispered
out of the corner of his mouth. “Our lives are in his
hands.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! The beautiful Miss Joan Epworth, flying
sister of the noted air man, Julian Epworth,” the
giant exclaimed. “I think that she walks like a fly into
our trap.”</p>

<p>He opened a drawer in the mahogany table and
pulled out a Los Angeles magazine. Opening the
magazine at a certain page he whirled the sheet around
so that she could see. Then he stared at her again. Joan
shrank back from that stare. There was something
dangerous about it that she could not understand.</p>

<p>But she understood the picture in the magazine.
It was her own picture.</p>

<p>“My lady,” continued the giant with distinguished
courtesy of speech but with a sarcastic stare in his
eyes, “that magazine is a year old. I have been keeping
it for a purpose. I planned in the near future to visit
Los Angeles with one of my fastest airships, and kidnap
you. That picture told me that you were a very
charming and fascinating young lady. Now that I see
you I realize that the magazine did not tell half of
the truth.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that speech?” Epworth
demanded sharply. “I will have you to understand
this girl is my sister, and is not to be hurt or insulted.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to hurt her. I wouldn’t hurt her for
a million dollars. All I am going to do is to make her
my wife. We are a little short of women up here in
the colony, and I have known for a year that she
would fit in admirably.”</p>

<p>“Marry you, you red-haired brute?” Joan cried
passionately. “I shall never marry you. Besides I do
not want a husband. I am just a school girl. I will
not be thinking of marrying for ten years.”</p>

<p>“You are old enough—quite old enough. I like them
young. But you will have to be satisfied with a rather
crude ceremony. We go very little on ceremonies here,
especially religious ceremonies. There are no priests
here, no churches here, no god to solemnize a marriage.
I am the only god here, but believe me I am a
big one. I make and unmake worlds.”</p>

<p>“You will never call this girl wife,” Epworth said
softly. “Not as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“Then you would fight for her? Fine.” He paused
and looked at them with narrowing eyes. “But I am
forgetting the astronomical lecture. I am the man
who is doing things with the moon. I am transforming
that satellite, which is a boiling caldron for fourteen
days and then a freezing Arctic Ocean for
fourteen days, into a pleasant place to live. It will
be a place where I can take my sweet comrades, and
establish a colony which will not be annoyed by world
dictators or tyrannical democracies.”</p>

<p>He paused and drew his hand across his huge
mouth, exposing his horse teeth as his hand left his
face. The act proved so repulsive to Joan that she
turned her head. The giant noted this and frowned.
The frown was not pleasant to behold.</p>

<p>“The moon you are aware has for untold centuries
been a dead planet,” he continued without rebuking
the girl but with a sinister contortion of his under
lip. “The scientists tell us that there is no atmosphere
there; no plant life; no water; and that men cannot
live there even if they could go there. I am fixing that
all up, working the moon over so that we will find life
quite pleasant when we go there. I am sending rocket
projectiles loaded with water from the Arctic Ocean
to the moon. A projectile leaves here loaded with ice;
immediately behind it goes another projectile carrying
liquid air, hydrogen and oxygen. Both projectiles
hit in the same spot on the moon, and the liquid air
explodes and forms a protecting velvet for the ice
water when it melts.”</p>

<p>He paused, and began to laugh, his sides shaking
up and down ludicrously. Again Joan had to turn her
head; again he eyed her savagely without saying anything
for a second. When he spoke there was a threat
in his voice.</p>

<p>“When you are my wife you’re going to have to
watch your risibilities,” he said gently. “But to proceed.
We delay—spread out too much for your small
minds. Taking cognizance of my projectiles, you see
the beginning to the Lake of Vapours. Fearing that
there may be no nitrogen on the moon I am sending
frequent projectiles loaded with saltpeter to unite
with the supposed volcanic soils, and make vegetable
life possible. In addition I am sending all kinds of
seeds—vegetable seeds, flower seeds, fruit tree seeds,
cereal seeds. They go mixed with commercial fertilizer
liquidized.”</p>

<p>“And you get the saltpeter and fertilizer from——”</p>

<p>The giant did not wait for Epworth to finish his
sentence.</p>

<p>“Various and sundry plants in the United States—from
Ford, Dupont, etc. The wholesale robberies you
were about to speak of are not what one would call
stealing. We need these things to start a great civilization
on another planet. Your people have them.
Unfortunately we have not the money to buy all we
need; and consequently we are forced to adopt the
methods of other nations. We take them.”</p>

<p>“And you think that this crazy idea is going to
work?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>Without realizing that she was speaking to the man
Joan shook her head.</p>

<p>“I am Herman Toplinsky, the greatest scientist in
the world. I have been run out of my home country
because I am too smart for the other scientists. I am
being hunted like a wild animal by all the governments
of the earth. This is why I am hiding in this
remote place with my comrades, and using my airships
to get chemicals, supplies, gold, and all the
things I need. Am I a bandit? Nay, nay. I am simply
a wronged scientist—a smart man without a country.
I cannot help the antagonisms of rude and ignorant
men.”</p>

<p>Epworth had heard of the man. He was no idle
boaster. Before he had been chased out of his home
country he had stood at the head of International
Science.</p>

<p>The scientist turned his eyes on Joan. She had her
fingers pressed on her nose, and could not remove
them before he discovered her act. He smiled, and
sprang nimbly forward.</p>

<p>“What you smell is my chemical laboratory,” he
explained. “It is in here.” He threw open a door. The
scent that came from the inner room caused the girl
to draw back quickly. “I have just removed my hands
from a vat of NH&#8323;.”</p>

<p>It was the smell of rotten eggs accentuated a hundred
times, and Epworth now knew that what had
been so repulsive to his nostrils since he had been in
the room was hydrogen mixed with sulphur and
nitrogen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />Ready to Crush Out Life</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">The guards, at a motion from the giant, pushed
the prisoners inside of the laboratory. Toplinsky
shot his eyes around the room for a second, and then
bounded forward with energetic fury across the floor
to where ten men were working as if death was just
ahead of them.</p>

<p>With a light slap of his big hand he turned a man
upside down, and rolled him across the floor.</p>

<p>“That for your ignorance,” he shrilled. “Have not
I, the great Herman Toplinsky, repeatedly told you
nitrogen is an inert element—that it does not care to
unite with other elements, and that we must be very
careful at the beginning if we want to live when we
get to the moon? We cannot wait until we can grow
vegetables. We must have nitrogen free for the atmosphere,
and we must also have it <em>fixed</em> so that we
can charge the new atmosphere with electric currents
and cause it to rain on the face of the moon. Yes, I,
the great Toplinsky, tell you all these things, and yet
you attend to this apparatus slothfully—you do not
complete the electric arc; you do not hook three hydrogen
atoms to one of nitrogen. Ah, ha! Do I not tell
you again, and again, that as condensed ammonia we
shoot it easily into the moon, and that when it releases
it becomes again hydrogen and nitrogen?”</p>

<p>He kicked the prostrate form of the unfortunate
worker, who was an American aviator, and turned
amiably to Joan and Epworth, all traces of anger disappearing.
Epworth and his sister looked at each
other in a puzzled way. Was the giant crazy? The idea
of shooting hydrogen and nitrogen at the moon in
small packages indicated that he was.</p>

<p>“My friends, it is so.” Toplinsky smiled amiably.
He was pleased with the impression he was making.
“I, the great Toplinsky, do more than shoot packages
of NH&#8323; to the moon. I shoot everything I need, and
soon—well, we shall see what we shall see. In the
meantime——”</p>

<p>He bowed like a diplomat to Epworth. The young
American caught the intent.</p>

<p>“Did I understand you to say that you objected so
violently to my marrying this young maiden that you
were ready to fight for her?”</p>

<p>Epworth shivered slightly. This was the biggest
man he had ever seen—a man as strong as Samson. If
he went into a fight with him it would be a very
desperate affair. He glanced at Joan. She was looking
at the giant with a loathing that she did not attempt
to disguise, and she was his sister.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am ready to fight for my sister. She shall
marry when she pleases, and the man she wants.”</p>

<p>Joan gave him a look of intense gratitude. She had
great confidence in her brother’s fighting ability.</p>

<p>Toplinsky turned away as if the matter was of no
more interest, and passed out of the house. As he
walked from the big building he waved his hand in
an explanatory way at two giant tubes buried in the
ground.</p>

<p>“Beneath these two tubes,” he remarked casually,
“I have a powerful power plant, and much complicated
machinery. With the electric current generated
by the ebb and flow of the Arctic Ocean I load the
cylinders with heavy blocks of ice, and then give the
projectiles a start into space. Lean heavily, my dear
bantam, lean heavily on this point. The projectile I
shoot leaves the earth at a speed of 6.77 miles per
second; that speed carries it beyond the gravity clutch
of the earth. When it gets a certain distance, in order
to land it at a certain spot on the moon, its speed is
accelerated by the explosion of a liquid rocket, fired
by clock work. It is easy when you know how.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” Joan ejaculated in admiration. “Why do
you shoot so accurately? Why not scatter your stuff
all over the moon?”</p>

<p>“It would be wasted,” he responded mildly. “I am
working on the same plan one acts when he builds a
dam in a flowing stream. Little by little I build outward,
making the territory around the point I have
selected inhabitable. In fact, in addition to creating
vegetation on the moon, I am preparing a livable
climate where I anticipate establishing my colony.
I am doing this—first, by locating my site in a deep
valley between two high ranges of mountains. Here
my lake and vegetation are established in a spot where
the sun shines one day out of the twenty-eight, and
then not with great heat. The rest of the time the
colony will be shaded from the sun by the high mountains,
and yet the valley will have ample light. For
heat during the long fourteen days of night I expect
to erect a solar heater on the top of the mountains,
and reflect the rays of the sun into Paradise Valley
with big mirrors. But let us hasten to the conflict. I
have not had a real good fight since I was a boy.”</p>

<p>Joan’s spirits dropped. The giant had been acting
so indifferently that she had come to the conclusion
that he had been bluffing about wanting to fight her
brother, and that he was simply trying to annoy her
with his talk about marrying her. Now she discovered
that she was mistaken.</p>

<p>She had not seen Toplinsky give a command but
as they approached the large hangar it seemed as if
the entire population had assembled for a celebration.
Against the walls of the hangar had been placed a
table, a space had been roped off in front of the table,
and a temporary arena made. Toplinsky mounted the
table, and addressed the crowd.</p>

<p>“Do you see this lovely maiden?” he shrilled out in
his small voice. “I think that she will make an excellent
mate for your leader. But notwithstanding the
fact that I want her there is a ruling among us that a
man can keep his wife just as long as he is able to do
so by main strength,—provided some other man wants
her. Unfortunately for me this lady has a brother,
and he is not willing to allow me to take her for
wife. But——”</p>

<p>He paused and looked down thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Really, I had forgotten something. I might buy
the lady. Mr. Epworth, I will give you twenty thousand
dollars for your permission as guardian to make
this girl my wife.”</p>

<p>Epworth looked at the giant apprehensively, saw
that he was soft, and shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>“He seems uppish about it,” the giant grinned.
“Very well, I shall <em>kill him with these great bare hands</em>!
I have said. It shall be an open fight, and no
favors.”</p>

<p>He threw off a long robe, and dropped to the
ground. Epworth was surprised to see that he was
clothed in tights, and that his massive chest swelled
out like a steam engine expansion.</p>

<p>The colonists gave a wild cheer. It was plain that
they liked a spectacular scrimmage.</p>

<p>“Bring in the girl and set her on the table,” Toplinsky
cried, “and then put fighting clothes on this
Lilliputian.”</p>

<p>Joan was seated on the table in great state while
the guards with rare good humor took Epworth into
the hangar and forced him to don tights. When the
young American came back to the arena and confronted
Toplinsky it was in reality a contest between
a Lilliputian and a giant, although Epworth’s figure
was beautifully shaped, symmetrical, smooth, and well
muscled for his age.</p>

<p>When the American prisoners saw the difference
in weight they groaned. Joan heard the groan and
paled. If Epworth was defeated she would take the
first possible chance to commit suicide. Life with the
giant monster was nauseating, horrifying. She thought
that she preferred death a hundred times. When
Epworth passed in front of the table on which she was
seated as if on a throne her heart went cold. The hairy
giant would crush him with ease, and there would
be no help for him. Those mighty hands would clench
around the boy’s neck, and he would never utter a
sound until choked to death.</p>

<p>Toplinsky meant to kill him. She did not have to
be told. Intuitively she recognized the fact that beneath
the giant’s sarcastic talk and extravagant boasting
there was a great hatred of Epworth. True she
had not seen the big scientist before this but he had
kept her picture for a year; had thumb-marked it
until it was black with grime and dirt. She groaned
inwardly. This came of too much publicity. How she
hated herself for letting that reporter get her picture
in his magazine. Vanity—how she hated her vanity
now that it was going to cost her the life of the only
companion she could trust.</p>

<p>“Ah, he is a bantam, a mere child!” There was a
smirk of satisfaction on Toplinsky’s face. “Yet he has
the temerity to stand up in front of me—the great
Toplinsky. Friends, comrades,” he made a grandiloquent
flourish with his hand, “it is not often that I
diverge but when I do it becomes great sport. And
this young lady—now hear me. I want her badly but
if this bantam wins he shall have her. What I have
said I have said. The great Toplinsky never goes back
on his word. So shall it be. Herloff, announce the
approach.”</p>

<p>A bugle sounded, a drum beat musically, a guard
jabbered in a strange language; then in broken English
he turned to the American prisoners.</p>

<p>“When this fight is over,” he said coldly, “this
young American will be dead.”</p>

<p>The calm statement, authoritatively made, caused
Joan to scream.</p>

<p>“Now, young sir, be on your guard. This is a fight
regardless of Marquis of Queensbury rules.”</p>

<p>Epworth was considerably astonished at the agile
rapidity with which the giant sprang forward. His
movements were graceful and as lithe as a panther. But
the American was ready for him. He had been taught
boxing and wrestling by skilled men. He waited like
a post until Billy Sand, watching with feverish excitement,
shouted:</p>

<p>“Snap into it, kid. For the love of Mike, snap
into it! You’re fighting for your life!”</p>

<p>Still he waited until the giant was at his elbow; then
he dodged with seeming lack of haste beneath Toplinsky’s
extended arms, and planted a heavy jab into
the man’s stomach. Then he turned his eyes on Billy,
and nodded. He was pleased to see Billy still alive.</p>

<p>But Toplinsky’s stomach was cast iron and copper
bottomed, and just a slight hesitation flickered across
his face. Epworth paled slightly. He had to subdue
this man by constant, steady, repeated body blows.
To strike him on the head, was like butting into a
brick wall with his fist, and the first blow indicated
that the soft portions of Toplinsky’s body were as
hard as his head.</p>

<p>Toplinsky whirled like an automaton, and rushed
with clenched hands. If he landed his blow Epworth
would be knocked cold. But it seemed as if Epworth
did not see his danger.</p>

<p>“Hey, kid!” Billy howled. “Look out for that John
L. rush.”</p>

<p>Billy’s voice was instantly checked by a guard who
put his hand over his mouth and jabbed a gun into
his side. Epworth, however, caught the feeling of
sympathy, and waved his hand. It did him good to
know that Billy was at hand to cheer him.</p>

<p>But he did not need the warning.</p>

<p>His footwork was smooth, and the giant pounded
air. Again Epworth’s right found lodging in the
giant’s abdomen, and he grunted a little, faintly, and
advanced with fists on guard.</p>

<p>It was evident that he knew a little about boxing,
and Epworth’s heart weakened. He had been counting
on Toplinsky’s ignorance. If the man was only partially
skilled his great weight, long reach, and massive
power gave him the decided advantage. Yet the young
American, though a little doubtful, had no intention
of permitting fear to gain possession of him. Fear, he
knew, would result in quick defeat.</p>

<p>He sprang forward like a catapult, dodged downward
just as the giant met him with a terrific blow at
his face, and got in two good blows before Toplinsky
could regain his equilibrium. Then with deft footwork
he slipped beneath the giant’s arms, battered him in
the rear of his short ribs, and darted out of reach.</p>

<p>“Atta boy! At——”</p>

<p>But again Billy’s mouth was choked off.</p>

<p>Toplinsky did not speak. Very quietly he paused,
and studied his opponent attentively. It was a menacing,
cruel, determined gaze. Joan caught his facial
expression and suppressed a cry of terror. She was
beginning to think that Epworth was a great fighter
for one so small and that he might whip this enormous
beast but that if he did Toplinsky would break his
promise, and be more terrifying in defeat than in
victory. His cruel red face expressed this thought. She
shuddered, and glanced helplessly at the colonists who
were backing Toplinsky. They were grim visaged
and fierce, and there was small promise of help in
that mass of intent, unsympathetic faces.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were broken by Epworth. The American
made a dash as if he intended to strike the giant
in the face. Toplinsky covered and shot his hands up
in front of his face. Instantly Epworth stopped his
rush, and kicked his opponent with all the force of his
leg and foot in the pit of the stomach. The giant
doubled up with a groan, and instantly Epworth sent
a mighty right hand blow to the back of his neck.</p>

<p>Toplinsky went down, his followers groaned, and
the Americans sent up a shout of triumph.</p>

<p>It was short-lived. The giant in falling threw out
his right and encircled Epworth’s neck. When he got
to his feet with his hands around the American’s
neck he gave a ferocious grin, and stuck his face,
streaming with blood, against Epworth, at the same
time jabbing the American with his left. Epworth
retaliated with a short hand jab into the scientist’s
stomach. Again the giant’s mighty left landed in
the American’s face. If he could not soon break loose
from the terrific embrace around the neck his face
would be pounded to a jelly.</p>

<p>Bending his head he lifted his feet, permitting the
giant to sustain his weight for a fraction of moment,
and doubling up slammed both feet with all of his
strength into Toplinsky’s abdomen. In order to sustain
his footing the giant held him up, and then
slammed his terrible left on his nose. The blood
spurted out like a pump working but in regaining
his equilibrium Toplinsky slightly relieved the
strangle hold around the American’s neck. Taking
the blow in his face, quick as thought Epworth struck
back with all of his strength, landing beneath the
giant’s chin. He had his mouth open at the time, and
his tongue was caught between his teeth.</p>

<p>It was not a severe blow but it caused Toplinsky to
bite his tongue. The pain was so severe that for a
second he released his grip around Epworth’s neck.
Epworth slid out of the clinch, and feeble-footed
aside. He was sick and groggy from that awful left
hand, and yet he realized that if the man had been
hammering him with his right instead of his left the
fight would have ended quickly.</p>

<p>Toplinsky, recognizing his advantage, rushed him,
giving him no time to recover from the shock of the
clinch. Unable to strike Epworth dodged. In this he
was far superior to his enemy. Now he darted right
and left, and remained out of reach of those mighty
arms. Thus he began to regain his breath.</p>

<p>“Keep away from him, kid,” Billy howled. “Don’t
try any more stunts. Give him shots in the stomach.”</p>

<p>Epworth kept away for a time but he couldn’t
knock a man out running from him, and when he
recovered somewhat he wheeled as if to run into the
giant, who was chasing him around in a circle. Toplinsky
stopped to throw up his guard, and envelop the
American again with his great arms. He failed. Epworth
shot in two punches, and got away, although
he was sighing for a gong to sound to end a round.</p>

<p>But this was not a battle by rounds, and now a
scheme entered his mind to tire out the giant. Still
dizzy and with his eye closing he began to invite the
giant to chase him. Toplinsky, foolishly thinking that
he was weakening, made repeated rushes. Epworth
avoided them as if weary and lacking energy.</p>

<p>The scientist’s admirers now sent up a whoop of
triumph. It looked as if the American was whipped.</p>

<p>Toplinsky chased until he began to blow slightly.
This was what Epworth was waiting for. Wheeling,
while seeming to run away, he charged into Toplinsky’s
face. To the observer it looked as if he was running
into certain destruction. Billy was the first to
groan; his fellow countrymen followed. The colonists
cheered.</p>

<p>Toplinsky smiled, showing his horse teeth in pleasant
good humor. He would catch this young American
by the nape of the neck and crush the life out of
him. First, however, he would cover his face and protect
himself from the American’s blow.</p>

<p>It was a terrible mistake. Never before had Epworth
driven a body blow with such terrific force. He
put all of his strength and the full weight of his body,
and landed in the giant’s stomach.</p>

<p>To the great astonishment of the observers Toplinsky
staggered, and before he could regain his footing
Epworth landed another under his chin, a fierce swipe.
The last blow rolled the giant over. But he was down
for only a second. In getting up he ran into some
angry punches below the belt. They made him sick,
weakened him, but he struck the American angrily
in the face, peeling the skin from beneath Epworth’s
eyes, and staggering him. Again the American got in
his fast footwork, backed away, and returned with
another rush into the giant’s stomach.</p>

<p>Strong as he was this rush doubled Toplinsky again,
and before he could straighten up Epworth was hammering
him from the left side below the belt. With
a mighty effort the giant closed his eyes to the pain,
and jabbed with all of his strength. Epworth caught
the blow on his chest, and struck the ground on his
back. Behind it there was enough power to knock
down a horse.</p>

<p>With a shrill scream like a wild animal Toplinsky
plunged at him. Epworth had just enough energy to
lift his foot and kick the rusher in the stomach. The
kick landed by accident in the exact spot where the
American’s fist had been hammering. Toplinsky
stopped short, turned white, and hunched over.</p>

<p>Hope swept again into Epworth’s heart, and with
a bound he was on his feet. Now he danced around
Toplinsky like a bull fighter. Flashing in and out, his
swift blows were delivered into the unprotected part
of the giant’s anatomy, finding soft places. Twice he
struck at the giant’s face, closing both eyes. This however
only served to give Toplinsky some relief from
his abdomen pains, and he rushed.</p>

<p>But Epworth was now going strong, and was wary.</p>

<p>He foot-worked, dodged in and out, and kept his
enemy breathing hard. Never for a second would he
permit those giant hands to get to his body or face.
In and out, like a shadow, quick as a wink, he pounded
without getting anything in return, seeking the vulnerable
spots.</p>

<p>With a sudden howl of anger Toplinsky dropped
his guard, and sprang at him. If he could just get his
hands on this fleet-footed foe. If——</p>

<p>But he spent his energy in the rush, and Epworth
was not there. Instead he was delivering those aggravating
blows at the solar plexus. Toplinsky paused,
whirled half around, and snarled like a wild animal.
It was an unfortunate thing for him to do. Epworth
rushed him, sent a powerful blow into the lower
regions and before the giant could straighten up, or
attempt to defend himself he slammed him along
the side of his left ear, and rolled him over. It was
the first time that Toplinsky had been floored until
he could not readily get to his feet.</p>

<p>Epworth saw his condition, and did not pause.
Dropping on top of his foe’s body, he pounded him
on both sides of his abdomen with terrible punches.
He was getting a little weak himself, and realized that
what he did must be done quickly.</p>

<p>“Take him off!” Toplinsky gasped in terror. “Help!
Quick, com——”</p>

<p>Epworth closed his mouth with a solar plexus blow
that put him out. Then he rose slowly and faced the
arena. In front of him were over a thousand frowning
colonists, hard featured, cruel men, with guns in their
hands. They were eyeing him threateningly.</p>

<p>Joan saw the menacing glances, and cried out. She
felt sure that these maddened men would not do the
fair thing by the brother who had fought for her so
gallantly—to the uttermost end of his strength. She
also feared for herself.</p>

<p>These men who did not hesitate to shoot down airships,
and steal, would shoot them later without
mercy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />Billy Takes a Part</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Six guards ran into the arena with a folding cot,
and stretched Toplinsky out comfortably on it.
He groaned miserably, lay silent for several moments,
and then lifted his head on his elbow. In this attitude
he gazed threateningly at Epworth for several seconds
without speaking, his light blue eyes twinkling
viciously.</p>

<p>“The woman is free,” he at last shrilled out. “I, the
great Herman Toplinsky have said, and it is so. But
for him—that is another thing. I have it. He has
dodged about like a jack-in-the-box, he has run away
from me and would not fight where I could reach
him with these strong arms, he has pounded me in
the softest parts of my anatomy when I could not catch
him. For that, ah, ha, he shall be whipped—whipped
until his back streams blood and he shouts aloud with
pain, until his head falls forward in a faint. Strap him
up. I have said.”</p>

<p>With a deep groan he dropped back on the cot, lay
on his back, for several seconds, and then turned over
so that he could view the whipping.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Oh, my! my stomach,” he half sobbed.</p>

<p>“How it hurts. Strap the rascal where I can see him
wither and suffer. I say that he shall suffer as I suffer.”</p>

<p>The six men jerked Epworth to a post in front of
the giant and lashed him face to the post, pulling
down his tights so that his back was exposed.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, his back is smooth and white. I shall make
it red and striped, and then pour salt on it. Proceed,
Kosloff, good comrade, and spare not the rod.”</p>

<p>The man addressed as Kosloff, a big double-jointed
man with a mean countenance, seized a cat-o’-nine-tails,
and began to whip Epworth unmercifully on his
back, each stroke cutting into the flesh and leaving
strips of red. Notwithstanding the fact that the pain
was excruciating Epworth clenched his teeth, and
uttered not a sound.</p>

<p>“One, two, three, four, five, and fifteen,” roared
the giant with pleasure. “Make him howl if it takes
two hundred. He’s a husky lad and can stand a lot.”</p>

<p>“Hold! One more stroke and I’ll blow you to bits!”</p>

<p>Epworth twisted his head. He first caught a view of
Joan with her face buried in her hands, weeping
hysterically; then his eyes flashed to the rope, and he
saw Billy standing inside with a gun frowning at Kosloff.
With a sudden dash he had grabbed a gun from
one of the guards and had covered the whipper before
he could be stopped.</p>

<p>Kosloff stopped, and turned white. There was a note
in the small American’s voice that brooked no rebellion,
and the gun pointed menacingly.</p>

<p>“Go on,” Toplinsky snarled, “until I shout stop.”</p>

<p>“Let him have it, Billy,” twenty American throats
shouted in unison. “We are with you. Plug him between
the eyes.”</p>

<p>“One more slash and he gets it,” Billy declared.
“Go on, Kosloff, if you have made your peace with
God.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put you on bread and water,” Toplinsky
threatened.</p>

<p>Kosloff held his whip undecidedly, and Billy stepped
swiftly across the intervening space and jabbed the
gun against Toplinsky’s head.</p>

<p>“You’ve got nerve, Toplinsky,” he said with grudging
admiration, “but you are too healthy to be in a
hurry to die, and I’m telling you that you are mighty
near death at this moment. I have been thinking
mean about you for the last hour and a half, and there
is now going to be a reckoning between us.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky, whose strength was coming back, sat up.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, slave, do you talk of an agreement with
your master?”</p>

<p>“Say, Whiskers, if you think I’m a slave you’ve
got another think coming. Right now you have a lot
of men behind you but I’m holding the trump card.
If you do not come to my terms, and agree quickly,
this gun is going off. After that—well, you will not be
interested in what happens next.”</p>

<p>The grimness in the young aviator’s voice spoke
volumes. The vast crowd listened in silence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued, “you are going to give an
order that sticks. You are going to say that there will
be no more whippings in this camp.”</p>

<p>“What else?” Toplinsky sneered.</p>

<p>“And no killings.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky made an effort to stand up.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” Billy thundered. “This agreement is
going to reach a conclusion before you get up.”</p>

<p>“I will agree that there will be no more whippings,”
Toplinsky said quietly, “provided the work
is done industriously. But the guards will shoot the
first American who makes a break for liberty. I have
said.”</p>

<p>“I will not be unreasonable,” Billy returned slowly.
“We will not ask for freedom at this time but we must
have fair treatment.”</p>

<p>“I will go no further than modify the regulations
concerning whippings,” Toplinsky declared firmly.
“What I have said I have said. Turn your gun over
to one of the guards.”</p>

<p>With a sarcastic bow Billy obeyed. The act surprised
Joan. She thought that Billy had the advantage,
and should force their release. But Billy had saved
Epworth from death, and Epworth and all the Americans
were well pleased with the result.</p>

<p>“Arrest that man!” Toplinsky screamed the moment
Billy was disarmed. “Put them together in the
stocks and throw mud at them.” When they were
bound together and their feet thrust through an
old-fashioned stock that was dragged out, Toplinsky
added slyly: “It may be puritanical but I imagine that
by the time my babies get through playing with you,
whippings will appear somewhat less painful.”</p>

<p>The mud was full of small sharp gravel and when
it began to strike their faces it left red smears. When
Joan saw this she sprang off the table, ran across the
open space to where the two boys were fastened, and
threw herself in front of them as a protection from
the gravel.</p>

<p>“Drag the wench back to her room,” Toplinsky
called out with a loud, shrill laugh, “and hold her there
in the window where she can see without being able to
interfere.”</p>

<p>Epworth and Billy were finally taken out of the
stocks in an unconscious condition.</p>

</div>

<p class="first">Kosloff came into Joan’s room, and surveyed her
with sneering eyes.</p>

<p>“Get ready! Quick! There is no time to lose. You
are going with us.”</p>

<p>“Going with you? Where?”</p>

<p>Joan felt a sudden depression creep over her. Was
this man going to separate her from her brother?</p>

<p>“Ask the general, or wait and find out. I have my
instructions.”</p>

<p>With another sneer Kosloff turned to the door,
paused, and looked back, and added:</p>

<p>“I am coming back in less than half an hour for
you.”</p>

<p>“I must get word to Julian or Billy,” Joan gasped.
“Where can they be taking me? Once separated from
my friends my life will be a constant misery.”</p>

<p>She paused in her cogitations, and began to tremble.
What could be ahead of her? She did not find out, and
threw herself across her bed. She was still lying with
her head buried in the bedspread when Kosloff returned.
This time he was accompanied by several
guards, who were none too polite. They lifted the
girl in their arms, and carried her aboard a large airship.
While they were taking her up a steel-like ladder
Joan had an opportunity to observe the machine carefully.
It was the biggest thing she had ever seen in
the way of an aircraft, being eight hundred yards long,
three hundred feet wide. In shape it was an elongated
cylinder, and she knew enough about modern metal
to discover that it was made of beryllium—a wonderful
new material impervious to heat or cold. The walls
were hollow, and heavily armored so that it was proof
against the strongest shells. The openings were sliding
doors with an inner door of glass. Thus, when the
outer door was closed, the entire ship seemed compactly
built without an opening. It was propelled by
rockets fired from long metal tubes located in the
bow, in the stern, and on both sides.</p>

<p>With rude hands her captors shoved her through
an open door and along a narrow companionway to
a small cabin daintily and charmingly furnished. Here
they threw her on the floor and departed, slamming
the door behind them. The second they were gone she
sprang to her feet. When she tested the door she found
that it had locked so that it would be impossible to
break out of the cabin. Then she began a search for
a window. There was none, and she ran around and
around the small chamber like a frightened rat without
getting anywhere.</p>

<p>Presently she began to beat the walls with her
clenched hands. She did not expect to gain anything
by this but it gave vent to her feelings. In the rear
of the room she accidentally struck a small round
knob with her thumb. The blow caused a secret panel
to slide back and expose an opening about eight inches
square. The opening was above her head but she
found a stool and climbed up on it.</p>

<p>Her eyes took in a large warehouse-like room full
of boxes and supplies piled from the floor to the ceiling,
and extending three hundred feet toward the
rear of the airship. Her mental comment was to the
effect that it was a mammoth apartment, and that it
held supplies enough to care for an army for several
months.</p>

<p>But the most interesting part of the room that confronted
her were the men who were loading the airship.
There were only three people in the warehouse
department, and two of them were Julian Epworth
and Billy Sand. They were being herded around by
a single guard who talked to them amiably and in a
friendly manner.</p>

<p>Fortunately as she looked through the opening they
passed very near, and the guard lagged.</p>

<p>“Julian! Billy!” she whispered softly. “I have been
locked up in this place. Can’t you get me out?”</p>

<p>Epworth heard her but for some time he could not
locate her. When he did, the guard was hurrying
them away. Joan saw them disappear behind some
boxes, and imagining that they had not heard her,
allowed despair to fill her soul. With a deep moan
she sank on a couch near by and buried her face in
her hands, leaving the panel open slightly but held
firm by the spring. She thought that she was deserted,
and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Epworth, however, had no idea of deserting her.
The second he heard her voice he knew that she was
entrapped on the airship and that he must devise some
scheme to save her. With this end in view, he dragged
slowly back of the guard. Billy, noticing this, fell
behind to talk to him.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose this ship is going?” Billy
asked indolently as he lowered his last burden to
the floor. “She seems to be loading up for a trip
around the world.”</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” the guard called out in an undertone.
“That mighty scientist, Herman Toplinsky,
is going to try to go to the moon, and, unfortunately,
I have been detailed to go with the crew.”</p>

<p>“Say, sonny,” Billy exclaimed enthusiastically, “that
sounds good to me. I don’t care if he never gets back.
Snap up, Epworth. We may find a chance to break
away while he is speeding along the interplanetary
ways.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of going with him,” Epworth whispered.
“He is kidnaping Joan, and taking her with
him.”</p>

<p>Billy gulped.</p>

<p>“How’d you find out?”</p>

<p>“Get a move on you, slow boys!” the guard called
out. “It is about time you were leaving the ship.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned his back carelessly on the two
Americans. Epworth glanced at Billy; Billy nodded
his head. Both edged up softly toward the guard.</p>

<p>“Out you go,” the guard shouted again. “Drop down
and I will stay on top until she starts.”</p>

<p>With two bounds Epworth and Billy were on
him. He was attacked unexpectedly and before he recovered
the two had him on the floor of the airship,
and his own gun sticking in his face.</p>

<p>“Not a word!” Epworth hissed.</p>

<p>“Not even a squeak,” Billy added.</p>

<p>The guard grinned up into their faces. It was a
good natured smile and half disarmed them.</p>

<p>“I do not get the idea,” he said in a low voice. “Are
you two contemplating a trip to the moon as a pleasure
jaunt? If you hold me here ten minutes you will be
on your way.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t part with you, Michael,” Billy
lisped. “No indeed. We love you too well.”</p>

<p>“We have known you long enough, Michael,” Epworth
explained, “to know that you are a good sort,
and I will tell you what we are doing. My sister has
been put aboard this airship, and is now a prisoner in
the room adjoining the wareroom. We are staying to
see that she is not mistreated.”</p>

<p>“Toplinsky is a dirty scrub,” Michael burst out,
angrily “and his people would not stand for this—not
after he had given his word. Anyway I am not
going to stand for it. Let me up—I am with you. I’ll
drop aboard and leave here, and get together a bunch
of men who will force Toplinsky to leave the girl
here. I am sure——”</p>

<p>The airship trembled from stem to stem, a muffled
explosion was heard on the outside; there came a sudden
upward jerk, and then a smooth, even motion of
acceleration.</p>

<p>“Too late,” Michael groaned nervously. “We are
off, and Toplinsky will boss you for several years
longer unless we are lost in space.” He paused and
added. “Do you know, Americans,” he spoke very
plain English, “that I have always thought that man
was crazy. He may have been hitting the moon with
his cylinder projectiles but I’ve always doubted it,
and I don’t feel good starting out to explore space. It
gives me the shakes.”</p>

<p>“Were it not for the fact that my sister is aboard this
plane I would feel the same way,” Epworth said. “But
with her future unsettled I am not thinking of what
is in front of me.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER X<br /><br />Toplinsky Calls the Bluff</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">The two Americans released Michael, and when
he got to his feet the three stood gazing at each
other in silence for several moments. Presently the
air began to get extremely cold.</p>

<p>“S-say, fellows,” Billy grated with his lips trembling,
“I don’t like this. If the weather continues like
this much longer I’ll become a little snowball.”</p>

<p>Michael bounded up and slammed the hatch down.
The atmosphere became slightly warmer.</p>

<p>“We can’t stay in here,” he asserted presently. “This
part of the airship is not connected with the oxygen
tanks, and we must have air to live.”</p>

<p>He again opened the hatch and looked out. Epworth
crowded up to him. Overhead was space, all
around them was space, and they were traveling at a
speed that took their breath. When they searched for
a view of the earth it was not to be seen, as the body
of the airship obscured it.</p>

<p>“We will try to get out and get into the other part
of the ship,” Epworth suggested.</p>

<p>“And Toplinsky will land on me for letting you
and your companion come aboard.”</p>

<p>Michael closed the hatch part way.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he added, “how will you pass that first
hatch opening. If you will look but again you will
see Toplinsky standing with his head out and an air
helmet over his head. For some reason he is on the
look out.”</p>

<p>This time he let the hatch down softly and closed
it firmly.</p>

<p>“We will fix you up with Toplinsky,” Epworth
proposed. “We will tie you up, then go below and inform
Toplinsky that we made you a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fine, but it won’t work. Toplinsky will give
me a beating for getting where you could put your
hands on me.”</p>

<p>The three men put their heads together. It was now
getting terribly cold, and for the first time they discovered
that breathing was painful.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something—and do it quick,” Billy
asserted anxiously. “I’m getting——”</p>

<p>He collapsed. Michael extended his hand to help
him, and also stumbled.</p>

<p>Like lightning Epworth acted. Grasping Billy by
the collar in one hand and Michael in the other he
pulled them up to the point in the warehouse where
the panel opened into the chamber Joan was occupying,
and drawing a box up put them in a position
where they could get a breath of air through the hole.
It was only a breath but he had reasoned that Toplinsky
would not put his sister where she would die for
want of atmosphere, and now found that he had
reasoned correctly. They could barely thrust a portion
of their faces toward the hole. It was not large
enough for all three to get air, and heroically he
pushed his companions forward.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p>Joan, stretched on her couch sobbing, heard a tap
on the panel that separated her compartment from
the storeroom. Curiously she got up and pushed back
the panel. In front of her was Billy’s face and the face
of a guard. Both were chattering with cold.</p>

<p>“O-open the panel full out,” Billy choked. “We are
dying for want of air.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” Joan ejaculated with infinite relief. “I
thought you had left the airship. Where is Julian?”</p>

<p>Billy shoved his head aside from the blessed air
hole and caught Epworth. He was just in time to keep
his companion from falling.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” he replied. “Get your face away from
the panel so we can all get a breath of that air. This
compartment is shut off from the air tanks and we will
soon die if we get away from this hole.”</p>

<p>However all three men soon revived, and pulled
boxes up to the air panel to stand on.</p>

<p>“We can’t stand here all our lives,” Billy grumbled.
“My legs are getting tired already.”</p>

<p>“Open your door and call some one,” Epworth instructed.</p>

<p>“It is locked,” Joan replied. “I have——”</p>

<p>The door opened and Herman Toplinsky stepped in.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho, ho, it is a great voyage—a magnificent
start.” Toplinsky closed the door carefully. “Indeed
a wonderful trip is ahead of us. We leave the earth
at a speed of six hundred miles an hour with our
liquid rockets working admirably. Fair Joan, do you
know where we are going?”</p>

<p>Joan was breathless with the fear that Toplinsky
would discover Epworth and Billy at the panel, but
when she replied her voice was cold and hard. At
least she could put this man in his place.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea, and my name—well, my
name is a good name and I am not ashamed of it. It
is Miss Joan Epworth to you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah ha, ho, ho, high hatty—somewhat ritzy. Well,
Miss Joan, we are on the way to the moon. By the
time we get there I am of the opinion that you will
be pleased to hear me call you Joan. This is our initial
trip—the first out—and I could not forego myself the
pleasure of seeing your beautiful face during the
journey. In fact I am crazy about you. Presently—ah,
ha, we shall see what we shall see.”</p>

<p>There was a treacherous threat in the words that
caused the girl to grow cold and hot by turns. The
words meant more than death to her.</p>

<p>“And how about that agreement with me?”</p>

<p>Toplinsky, startled with surprise, looked up at the
panel. Epworth was gazing at him with blazing eyes
over the blue barrel of a gun.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho, ho.” The giant was not in the least
disconcerted. “Our bantam fighter—our fast foot
runner. Now I wonder how you got in there? But
that is a matter of indifference. Long before we get to
the moon you will be frozen into an Eskimo pie. It
suits me well. I think that I shall move this young
lady into another apartment, and seal this one. We
can get along very well this trip without this room.
Of course——.” He paused as if thinking deeply, and
an ugly sneer appeared on his mouth. “Yes, I really
believe that such an act would prevent any air from
getting back into the store room.”</p>

<p>The cool, devilish ingenuity of the man was appalling.</p>

<p>“Y-y-you mean that you will let these men die in
there for lack of breathing air?”</p>

<p>Joan’s face was deathly white as she asked this question.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell them to go in there,” the giant apologized
with asperity. “Probably they were trying to
hitch-hike a ride with us, thinking that we were going
to some other part of the world, and got caught in
their own trap. Why should I trouble myself about
them? If they die I assure you that decomposition will
not commence during the trip to the moon. The
frigid air will act like a refrigeration process, and
preserve their bodies from offensive smells. We can
dump them out when we get to the moon. Their
carcasses will make good fertilizer.”</p>

<p>“Toplinsky, I confess that I do not get you.” Epworth
spoke calmly. “I do not understand your actions
concerning Joan. You gave me your word, and
I thought that your word would stick.”</p>

<p>“I do stick to my word,” Toplinsky shrilled in intense
anger. “The man who says that Herman Toplinsky
is not a man of his word is a liar—a double-dyed
liar by the town clock.”</p>

<p>“And yet my sister is here—kidnaped.”</p>

<p>“Just so.” The giant smiled broadly. “Still I have
not broken my word. I did not promise you that I
would not take her with me to the moon. I did not
tell you that I would cut her off my visiting list. On
the contrary I have seen to it that she was treated like
a great lady. She has been given every comfort, and
I intend to see that she is treated with distinguished
courtesy on this trip.”</p>

<p>He showed his teeth aggravatingly.</p>

<p>“Sounds fishy but you are going to put that down
in writing. You are going to sign a written agreement
that she shall not be harmed or insulted, and you
are going to agree that we can go along to see that
you keep your word. With me is my chum, Billy Sand,
and the guard you put over us. These two are also
going with you. I will add, in justice to the guard,
that we knocked him down and took his gun away
from him, making him a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Really, my dear fellow, I am seriously afflicted with
writer’s cramp.” Toplinsky spoke politely. “I cannot
put such an agreement in writing. It would be very
painful to me to have to write it.”</p>

<p>“We may never leave this store room alive,” Epworth
said threateningly, and it was evident that he
meant what he said, “but as sure as fate if you do not
put that agreement in writing I shall shoot you. One
explosion will be all that will be necessary.”</p>

<p>The giant did not seem to be frightened. Quite the
contrary. He replied very quietly.</p>

<p>“Quite a marksman, eh?” Toplinsky’s smile was
sneeringly cold and mocking. “Do you know what
will happen if I am killed? I hope I may not seem
pedantic if I modestly explain. I am the only person
aboard the Aerolite who can pilot it back to the earth,
or to the moon. If you shoot me, all on board will
be lost in space. It is hardly necessary to inform you
that the moon does not stand still. It is moving now
in three ways. First it is rotating once every sixteen
hours on its axis; second it is moving around the
world once every twenty-eight days; third it is traveling
through space in a giant circle with the earth
around the sun, making the circle once in three hundred
and sixty-five days. Off-hand I would suggest that
these three statements alone, especially numbers two
and three, present to you, an expert air navigator,
something of a problem in the way of making the
moon a landing spot.”</p>

<p>He paused and grinned broadly, seeing a look of
dismay appear on the American’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued pleasantly and in an academic
manner, “the moon moves 0633 miles each second—double
the velocity of a cannon ball, and add to this
the encircling movement of one thousand miles an
hour around the sun, we have a decided mathematical
calculation in navigation—especially as our little ship
is at present only making six hundred miles an hour.
Perhaps, a little later on we may get up to eight hundred.
But, my dear fellow, do I see you, even at a speed
of eight hundred miles an hour, overtaking the moon?
I pause for a scientific response.”</p>

<p>Epworth was obviously upset, and his hand
trembled on the trigger.</p>

<p>“Toplinsky, it is all I can do to keep from killing
you this instant.”</p>

<p>“If you really wish to see your sister live——. Well
to be just a little slangy, you will draw in your horns.
Kill me and you also kill her and the crew.”</p>

<p>“And you will leave my brother and his companions
in there without air to breathe?” Joan demanded
heatedly.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, really, we have no air to
spare.” Toplinsky lifted the palms of his hands outward,
and shook his head. “We manufacture our air
with chemicals, and the supply is limited. In making
my preparations to visit the moon I did not anticipate
the presence of guests in a compartment where no
air is needed. Our air is confined entirely to the living-parts
of the ship. Yours is the last compartment supplied
with air. There is no sense in wasting air and
running machinery for fun.”</p>

<p>Again he opened his hands expansively, and showed
his horse teeth apologetically.</p>

<p>“And—and——”</p>

<p>“So there you are,” he finished.</p>

<p>Epworth lowered his gun.</p>

<p>“Toplinsky, you win. I cannot endanger the lives
of all the people aboard this airship.”</p>

<p>The giant grinned good humoredly. He had been
very close to death, and he realized that his escape had
been narrow.</p>

<p>“Don’t kill them that way,” Joan moaned. “I shall
not give you any trouble. I——”</p>

<p>“Joan, that is enough!” Epworth hissed. “You are
going to obey me, and you are going to stay right in
this room during the entire trip—stay where I can
keep my eyes on you.”</p>

<p>“Where you can keep your eyes on her, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>Toplinsky smiled crookedly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XI<br /><br />Tables Turned and No Eats</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">With a cautious movement that did not attract
Toplinsky’s attention Billy Sand touched Epworth
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“The hatches may be closed but not locked,” he
suggested in a whisper. “Perhaps we can get out on
the top of the old crate, and find a way to get inside of
the airchambers.”</p>

<p>Epworth dropped down as silently as possible from
the air hole. The second he was away from the hole,
Toplinsky popped up, and slammed the panel shut.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, my young cockerel,” they heard him exclaim
exultantly, “I guess that will fix you. I have not
promised that I would save your life when it was in
jeopardy. True I have said that I would not kill you.
While this was under durance I shall stick up to it.
However I am not responsible for the temperature of
space. You should have remained where you belong.”</p>

<p>They heard him cackling shrilly but without pausing
to hear more, accompanied by Michael, who had
informed them that his last name was Strauss,
they ran hurriedly to the hatch, pushing it open.</p>

<p>“Lady Luck,” Epworth exclaimed as he stepped out
on the top of the airship. “Not a living object in view,
but——”</p>

<p>He was going to speak of the force of the wind but
realized with surprise that there was no wind. They
were already beyond the earth’s stratosphere.</p>

<p>They climbed out of the storeroom, dropped the
hatch door into place, and started to walk along the
narrow runway over the top of the plane. Epworth,
who was in the lead, glanced outward.</p>

<p>Six hundred miles an hour, and no place to fall. In
every direction extended a dense black sky, lighted
by gleaming balls of red that he knew were stars and
the sun—nothing above, nothing below, and on each
side endless ether. If they fell off this ship going with
incredible swiftness, where would they go? They were
now too far away from the earth to fall back on the terrestrial
globe, and even if the gravital drag of the
earth grasped them they would be frozen stiff before
they got there, or shattered into fragments if they
landed. It was a cold, clammy, helpless feeling. Once
off that ship they would go nowhere; they would find
death in endless space, where it is supposed to be 439°
below zero.</p>

<p>Aside from this they realized that they had very
few minutes to spare. They must get below into the
air chambers very quickly or perish with cold, or in
the rare atmospheric void.</p>

<p>All three were suddenly afflicted with vertigo, and
began to reel along dangerously near the edges of the
little platform-run. Realizing that this was certain
destruction, they gained control of their faculties by
sheer force of will power, and holding their breath
dashed up to the first hatchway, and pulled at the
ring.</p>

<p>It was locked on the inside, and therefore immovable.</p>

<p>For a second Epworth was appalled. Had Toplinsky
beaten him to the idea of escape? If so they were
doomed. Already it was too late for them to run back
to the storeroom hatch opening. They were too far
spent to undertake it.</p>

<p>Had they simply jumped from one death to another
in leaving the storeroom? Epworth shivered at
the thought—with cold as well as the fear of death. For
the first time he thought of his body floating through
space, embalmed in ice.</p>

<p>Then gathering his courage he ran on to the next
hatch opening. By this time he had discovered that
the openings in the top of the airship were four in
number and about equal distances apart.</p>

<p>Glory be! The hatch door was locked but a small,
slender stairway ran down the side of the ship to a
side door. Like a monkey he flashed down this stairway
followed by his companions. They dropped onto
a small square platform, and Epworth caught the
bright knob of the door. If it was locked they were
as good as dead men. They were still holding their
breath, and life hung by a hair.</p>

<p>He jerked at the door nervously. It slid open, and
he darted in instantly. As his companions came down
the ladder he caught each frantically and pulled him
inside, closing the door.</p>

<p>With one motion the three opened their mouths,
and gulped down the living, warm air. They were all
but gone, and it required several seconds for them
to recover.</p>

<p>They were treading softly down the narrow companionway
when a door opened and Toplinsky came
out of Joan’s room.</p>

<p>“By this time,” he was saying, “that young brother
of yours is dead, and I am going to change your place
of abode.”</p>

<p>He extended his hand to pull the girl out of the
room.</p>

<p>“I’m not going. I’m going to stay here, and get that
panel open so my brother can get air.”</p>

<p>She jerked back, and the giant put forth some force
to move her.</p>

<p>Epworth bounded forward with fierce anger, and
before the giant could turn brought the butt of his
gun down on the giant’s head.</p>

<p>“Get inside, and lock the door,” he urged. “Make
it snappy—before some one else drifts along.”</p>

<p>“Not by myself,” Joan protested quickly, sensing
that in some miraculous manner Epworth and his
friend had escaped death in the storeroom. “You and
Billy must come in also.”</p>

<p>“Michael Strauss, the guard who is with us, must
also come.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say.”</p>

<p>“In with you, Billy.”</p>

<p>Billy and Michael entered the room while Epworth
guarded Toplinsky with his gun. Just as Michael disappeared
Toplinsky came around. He had been
knocked a little silly but was not totally out—just
enough to permit Billy and Michael to get into Joan’s
room without being discovered.</p>

<p>“Not a move! Not a whimper!” Epworth thundered
when he discovered that Toplinsky was coming back
to the world. “There is not going to be a loud noise.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, so you would threaten again,” Toplinsky
shouted. “Ho, comrades, this way.”</p>

<p>The scientist was demonstrating that he was a man
without fear.</p>

<p>Epworth did not wait for the guards to appear, and
from natural kind heartedness did not strike the giant
with the gun. Instead he slipped into Joan’s room,
and slammed and locked the door.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” he murmured. “Now if they do
not shut off the supply of air.”</p>

<p>“If he does that,” Michael explained, “we can
knock a hole in the door, and get air from the outside.
The ship is constructed so that the air is always
inside of the companionway.”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” Billy grinned in high good
humor. “We are all dressed up and on our way.”</p>

<p>“On our way,” Joan interposed, “but while we are
traveling what will we eat? I am already hungry.”</p>

<p>The three Americans looked at each other in dismay.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XII<br /><br />Toplinsky Grinned Slyly to Himself</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Without speaking his thoughts, Michael stepped
to the side of the room, and shoved a hidden
panel aside, exposing to the view of his companions a
small room containing a lavatory and supplies. Thrusting
a plug in the white bowl he turned on a faucet and
filled the bowl with water.</p>

<p>“I did that,” he explained, “as a precaution in case
the general turns the water supply off of this apartment.
It would necessitate considerable work and a
general overhauling but it is possible to stop the water.
With this bowl full we will have enough to drink until
we get to the moon—provided, of course, Toplinsky
gets there in the time he has allowed for the trip.
But as for eats I am afraid that we will have to get
outside occasionally. My brother is the cook, and if
I could get out to the kitchen we could get a supply
of edibles without Toplinsky getting much too
wise.”</p>

<p>Epworth tiptoed to the door of the companionway,
opened it slyly, and peeped out. A guard was standing
in front of the entrance with a gun in his hand. Toplinsky
had disappeared.</p>

<p>“We will be watched constantly,” he explained, as
he closed the door softly. “There is a man out there
with a gun on the door.”</p>

<p>He spoke despondently.</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” Michael said thoughtfully. “Probably
he does not know that Michael Strauss is in bad with
the general. If I step out there he may think that I
have been placed inside as a guard, and I can get a
chance to knock him out.”</p>

<p>Epworth gave this idea consideration for some time.
Finally he smiled.</p>

<p>“Did Toplinsky know that you were guarding us
in the storeroom?”</p>

<p>“If he did it was an accident. He seldom pays attention
to such small details. I was sent in by Kosloff.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I see how we can eel out of this. You can
go out, and talk to the guard. While you are talking
Billy and I will slip out and help you knock him out;
then we will drag him in here, put him in the closet,
and you can take his place. Toplinsky will not know
that there has been a change of guards, and will think
that he is the man we knocked out in the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Sounds easy.”</p>

<p>Michael nonchalantly opened the door, and slid
out into the companionway. Immediately the guard
threw a gun down on him.</p>

<p>“You can’t come out here,” the guard snarled in a
surly way. “The general instructed me to let no one
pass.”</p>

<p>“I’m not trying to pass,” Michael protested carelessly,
“but I’m fed up with guarding that bunch inside.
How would you like to exchange places?”</p>

<p>“Not me. I’m staying where the general put me.”</p>

<p>Michael carelessly stepped up to the guard.</p>

<p>“Got a cigarette?”</p>

<p>“Cigarette.” The guard smacked his lips. “I’m crazy
for one but you’ve got your crust asking for one. The
general says that we are liable to blow up the ship, as
it is full of hydrogen gas. In fact, if he should catch
you smoking I’d hate to be in your shoes.”</p>

<p>Michael leaned negligently against the wall, and
the guard lowered his gun and turned half around. He
was startled by a noise at the door. He whirled but
was too late. Epworth and Billy landed on his back
like a pile of brick, and Epworth’s hand closed over
his mouth and throat.</p>

<p>Struggling fiercely the guard dropped his gun.
Michael picked it up with a chuckle, and slammed
him on the head. The blow partially stunned him
and Epworth and Billy dragged him into Joan’s room,
and with a bedspread stripped into cords bound him.
The second they released his throat he sent up a loud
shout for help.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” Epworth advised, shoving the gun
against his side. “If there is any talking to be done
Michael will do it.”</p>

<p>Michael did. Toplinsky heard the shouts and came
running. When he got to Joan’s room he found
Michael on the outside acting as the guard.</p>

<p>“What is the matter here?” the general demanded
harshly.</p>

<p>Michael saluted.</p>

<p>“They must be killing our comrade in there,” he
responded somewhat indifferently. “He has been
howling loud enough to raise the dead.”</p>

<p>“Why do you not look inside?”</p>

<p>“You told me to stay here, and let no one come
out,” Michael answered stupidly. “I’m doing it.”</p>

<p>“Pig! All of you are pigs,” Toplinsky blustered.
“I meant, of course, for you to exercise some judgment.”</p>

<p>The giant turned the door knob and pushed. The
door was fastened tightly on the inside with a bolt but
he heard a loud sputtering that Epworth choked off
quickly.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” Epworth roared. “I’ll choke the life
out of you.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing to my comrade in there?”
Toplinsky demanded. “I——”</p>

<p>“Just choking him a little,” Epworth responded
amiably. “Of course you do not mind a little thing
like that. It hasn’t been two hours since you left him
in the storeroom to die. However, if he obeys me he
will not be hurt. I am only making a good fellow out
of him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, let it be so.” Toplinsky turned away. “He
deserves some punishment for falling into your
hands.”</p>

<p>“Shall we leave our comrade in there without anything
to eat?” Michael asked innocently.</p>

<p>Toplinsky stopped short.</p>

<p>“We will have to feed them,” he replied thoughtfully.
“I could not think of leaving him there without
food—or the girl either. As for the two Americans—well
we cannot feed our comrade and the girl without
feeding them, so when the dinner hour arrives
you may instruct the cook to bring them something
to eat.”</p>

<p>Michael saluted and turned his face away to grin.
Toplinsky strode away angrily. He would fix the two
Americans, he promised himself—fix them plenty—when
he got to the moon. They were prisoners aboard
the Aerolite, and he would find some method of disposing
of them if they undertook to leave the ship.</p>

<p>He grinned slyly to himself.</p>

<p>But he would have to dispose of them carefully. It
would not do to break his promise. No indeed. He
must stand by his promises or his men would go back
on him. He couldn’t afford to allow this.</p>

<p>His method of eliminating that upstart Epworth
must necessarily be unique. But he mentally promised
himself that it would be certain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />The Landing</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">A sudden burst of light, stronger than the meridian
sun, flashed into Epworth’s face, causing
him to jump excitedly.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” he exclaimed. “Is the ship on fire?”</p>

<p>“The general is throwing open all the windows,”
Michael Strauss replied from outside of the door. “We
are approaching the moon. Come out and peep
through a windowpane. It is safe. The crew is busy at
the far end.”</p>

<p>Epworth slipped out of Joan’s cabin into the companionway.
From where Michael stood they could
see out and downward. Far below him Epworth saw
a rounding world, full of deep pits, enormous craters,
steep mountains. For several moments he gazed at it
in silence and awe, and then his mind flashed back
to a previous air ride he had taken. This was almost
exactly like flying over Mount Vesuvius.</p>

<p>He was still standing at the window gazing downward
when Joan and Billy joined him.</p>

<p>“That prisoner in there,” Billy observed. “What
are we going to do with him if we make a landing?
From what I see we are about ready to drop.”</p>

<p>They shot suddenly across a range of high mountains
and came to a long level stretch of shimmering
white.</p>

<p>“If a landing is made we will have to tie him up
and——”</p>

<p>Epworth had not completed his sentence when the
Aerolite dropped downward and landed as light as a
feather. When he turned to look out again he discovered
that they were located on the peak of a high
mountain that sheered off almost straight down for
ten thousand feet to a long level stretch of land composed
of brownish colored soil. This stretch of land
sloped gradually eastward. Remembering that east
was west and west was east on the moon, Epworth
tried to establish the point of landing from his knowledge
of the surface of the moon as outlined by Flammarion.
The moon, he knew, was now full, and the
entire surface was flashed with sunlight—that is the
portion that faced the earth.</p>

<p>But, to his astonishment, they were not landing in
the light of the sun.</p>

<p>When the ship came to a stop and he was able to
get a better view of their surroundings he discovered
that they were surrounded by a dim reflected light
that came from the east. On the west the darkness was
steadily deepening. While he was still watching the
darkness in wonder, the colonists began to pour out
of the ship onto the moon.</p>

<p>They looked strange—not at all like men—and Epworth
gasped slightly as he recognized the fact that
they were encased in air helmets, and wore heavy iron
shoes to maintain a balance on the light gravity of the
small globe.</p>

<p>The moment they landed the men began to unload
sheets of metal silvered into giant reflectors.</p>

<p>“W-w-what are they going to do?” Joan gasped in
astonishment. “Why all those sheets of silvered
metal?”</p>

<p>“That Toplinsky is a deep man,” Michael responded
in awe. “He has never been on the moon
before, but he has a great scheme to make it inhabitable
by men. That silvered metal, when completed,
and erected, will be his first moon mirror. If you
notice it is to be erected on a particular point of this
mountain—just beyond the part visible from the earth.
For fourteen days the sun will be reflected directly
toward the earth, and then the rays will move further
westward, finally presenting only a dark sphere to the
earth. This results, Toplinsky says, in the establishment
of a line on the moon which is always lighted
by the appearance of the sun in the distance. This
line travels into the sunlight and retains the light of
the sun while the face of the moon fronting the earth
is dark. Thus, at a point only several miles removed,
when the sun disappears from the Sea of Vapours, we
will say, it touches the mountain system on the west
and remains there until the moon’s movements shift
it back again. Toplinsky’s scheme is simple. He intends
to locate mirrors on that line, catch the light
of the sun as it disappears from the part facing the
earth, and reflect its heat down into the valley. With
the heat naturally will come the reflected light. In
this manner he will build solar heaters to overcome
the cold and darkness of the long night. Naturally
he will locate his colony close to the mountain where
it will be near the solar heaters.”</p>

<p>Hardly had Michael finished his explanation when
some of the colonists re-entered the airship, and
started the machinery. Again they lifted in the air.
But they were not up long. For ten minutes they
sailed over a dark line where the rocks showed beneath
them rugged and mountainous, and then they
flitted like a long silent streak across the line of
darkness into a brilliant sunlight. Here Toplinsky
dropped the airship quickly to the ground, and
presently they landed in a small, narrow valley on
the bank of a lake half a mile in diameter.</p>

<p>“That is some more of Toplinsky’s work,” Michael
explained. “He made that lake by shooting rockets
filled with water from the Arctic Ocean. The rockets
also contained liquid air and enough hydrogen and
oxygen to protect the water from evaporation.”</p>

<p>Epworth sauntered down the companionway, and
peeped out of the door. The colonists were again leaving
the ship, protected by their air helmets.</p>

<p>“Does he expect to find hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
and other elements here?” Joan asked.</p>

<p>“He left orders for the men behind to continue to
shoot the rockets filled with chemicals at a certain
spot, gradually drawing eastward so as to enlarge the
lake.”</p>

<p>“It is light enough here,” Epworth observed, “but
I perceive that Toplinsky has landed in a spot where
the country is shaded for ten miles by the high mountain
on which he left his mirrors. That mountain
must be six miles high.”</p>

<p>“Another part of his colonizing scheme,” Michael
explained. “He thinks that if men can be protected
from the rays of the sun the heat will not be unbearable
during the long day.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Epworth was considerably astonished at the
giant’s scientific ideas. “The shadow of the mountain
will certainly moderate the heat, but I am yet to be
convinced that he can generate enough heat with his
mirrors and solar heaters to warm up the valley during
the long night.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to him. See that long strip of light?”</p>

<p>Michael pointed to a narrow slit of sunlight that
suddenly shot down from the top of the mountain.
It came straight down like a ladder, piercing the
darkness of its source and dropping down in brilliant
coruscations on the rugged rocks on the west end of
the little lake, and sweeping swiftly over the level
stretch of land between the mountain and the lake. It
brought brilliant light and heat.</p>

<p>“I’m for getting out of here,” Billy put in.</p>

<p>“Fine,” Epworth replied scathingly, “but how are
you going to live out there? The colonists are wearing
air helmets, and that indicates to us that if we
undertake to leave the Aerolite we must find some
way to store oxygen over our own heads.”</p>

<p>“There are air helmets in the storeroom,” Michael
suggested, “and an oxygen tank in the cook room.
Perhaps——”</p>

<p>But without waiting for a command from Epworth,
he sped down the companionway into the kitchen.
When he came back he was carrying three air helmets.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he said energetically. “I found
them hanging near the kitchen oxygen tank, and of
course filled them so that you can use them.”</p>

<p>“But, how will we refill them after we exhaust the
supply now imprisoned in them?” Epworth protested.
“I——”</p>

<p>“I brought along a recharger, and——”</p>

<p>“Even so, one recharge will not last us long.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we may not need them after all,” Joan
suggested. “The colonists are taking them off their
heads.”</p>

<p>Epworth opened the window cautiously and stuck
his head out.</p>

<p>“There is atmosphere here,” he observed slowly,
“but it is exceedingly thin.”</p>

<p>“It is not half as thin as these air helmets promise
to become,” Billy snorted, “and I think I can explain
it. The astronomers on the earth cannot see deep into
these craters. They see only the tops of the mountains,
and the atmosphere has done the same as it does on
the earth—sought the lower levels, being pressed down
from above and gathering density in the holes and
caves.”</p>

<p>“That being the case right here we separate from
Toplinsky,” Epworth decided quickly. “If we wait
he will put a watch over the ship, and cut off our
escape.”</p>

<p>“You say that Toplinsky has been shooting liquid
air, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen up here?”</p>

<p>Joan put the question to Michael as if she had just
heard this, and Epworth looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Epworth answered, taking the words
out of Michael’s mouth. “That has been gone over
half a dozen times.”</p>

<p>“True, but a new idea has just struck me. Perhaps
the liquid air and all the other ingredients that make
air, which Toplinsky shot up here, made good
breathing air when the explosions occurred and that
enough have been unloaded from the earth to create
a small air circle at this point.”</p>

<p>“Such atmosphere would be held down at this
point by the pressure from above,” Epworth agreed,
“and remain in natural form.”</p>

<p>“If my theory proves true,” Joan continued, “we
can breathe only when we are near the lake.”</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, we will go out and see how we
get along but be sure to hold on to your air helmets.”</p>

<p>Locking the prisoner inside of the small cabin the
three Americans moved softly down the companionway
toward the kitchen. On the way they caught a
glimpse of Toplinsky and his men standing in a circle,
with their air helmets in their hands, while several
of the company were turning up the soil with shovels
for Toplinsky to examine. The scientist was doing
this carefully, and Epworth could not restrain a
thought of admiration. The man was certainly a
thorough scientist, and in his scheme to make the
moon inhabitable he would be sure to plant vegetation
that would grow prolifically.</p>

<p>Michael had informed them that there was a companionway
beyond the kitchen which would lead
them to the opposite side of the ship, and they had
been thoughtful enough to get instructions that would
enable them to locate it. When they arrived at the
kitchen they found it deserted, the entire outfit having
rushed to see the landing, and with very little trouble
they gained the companionway. But when they came
to the door that opened out on the small balcony on
the opposite side they found it locked.</p>

<p>For several moments the two men were puzzled.
Epworth fumbled at the lock without result, and then
Billy took his place. Billy, being a mechanic of great
ability, used the blade of his knife and after working
for some time forced the bolt back, and pulled the
door inward. With beating hearts they ran down the
ladder and stepped upon terra firma.</p>

<p>Here they paused for a brief consultation. They
were hidden from Toplinsky’s men by the airship but
it was evident that if they escaped they would have
to run for it in the open. The nearest protection consisted
of a range of small mountains on the south.
There were other mountains on the north but these
were too far away, although they were taller and more
promising as a hiding place. Both ranges appeared
rocky and rugged, treeless and desolate. In front of
the Aerolite, stretching as far as the eye could reach
was a pitted desert of white ashy sand dunes; behind
the machine was the newly made lake which rippled
softly on a nearby beach; beyond this the mountain
with the solar heat.</p>

<p>“We will have to try the southern mountains,” Epworth
said briefly, “and run like scared rabbits. It is
lucky, Joan, that you are wearing short skirts.”</p>

<p>“Let us scatter,” Billy proposed, “and meet at that
large rock which is projecting over that lower mountain.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” Joan objected quickly. “I’m staying close
to Julian. I might need his strong right arm.”</p>

<p>“Then all together.”</p>

<p>They kept the Aerolite between them and their
enemies as long as possible, and then broke into a
run.</p>

<p>Their attempt to run was at first ludicrous. Being
used to the gravity drag of the earth they put forward
all their efforts in taking long quick steps. Instead of
steps these muscular movements proved to be jumps,
and they moved like Jack in the Magic Boots, covering
about thirty yards in a single step, and jerking
their legs up ludicrously when they took the next step.
In fact, after getting off the ground it took an effort to
put their feet back.</p>

<p>Joan immediately tumbled over, laughing somewhat
fearfully.</p>

<p>“This will not do,” she exclaimed anxiously, as she
fell the second time. “I can’t run. Let us walk.”</p>

<p>Epworth, the second step he took, discovered the
situation, and was moving in accordance with what he
thought a moon action should be. It was not perfect
but it kept him from falling and was a rapid mode of
advance. He now stopped and gave them instructions
in the way he thought they should move. While he was
doing this Toplinsky came around the side of the Aerolite
and discovered them. At the time they were probably
about twelve hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, they run,” he shrilled in that sharp voice
they had learned to dread. “Our guests are wearying
of their entertainment. They would leave us without
bidding us farewell. Atta, boys, up and after
them!”</p>

<p>He started on a big run for the Americans. Epworth
expected to see him fly up and turn over but
the giant was too scientific-wise. He came on with a
hop-skip-and-jump that seemed to make him fairly
skim over the ground.</p>

<p>“A regular flying squirrel,” Billy grunted, “and
dangerous as a snake.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky landed in front of Epworth with a broad
grin.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho, ho, my bantam American pugilist, we
meet again, and on different footing. This time we
shall fight in the same way, but with different results.
Then I shall be freed of my promise.”</p>

<p>He stared savagely for several seconds into the
American’s face, and then leaning forward, with his
little eyes twinkling, he aimed an ugly blow at Epworth’s
head. The American attempted to dodge it
but the difference in the gravity pull made him clumsy
and he half-floated to one side, the blow striking him
on the chest, spinning him around and rolling him
forty feet.</p>

<p>“Run, Joan,” he shouted. “Make for the mountains.
I can’t fight here. Billy will take care of you while I
hold this great brute.”</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet as Toplinsky tore down
on him.</p>

<p>“Shall I shoot him?” Billy asked softly.</p>

<p>“And stay on the moon all the rest of your life?”
Toplinsky shrilled. “Shoot, will you? Shoot! I’m the
only man who can take this expedition back to the
earth.”</p>

<p>He stopped, tore open his shirt and exposed his
hairy chest.</p>

<p>“Run,” Epworth urged. “Keep your cartridges as
long as possible. I will attend to this gentleman.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to see what Billy did, Epworth
squatted, sprang forward, and threw his arms around
Toplinsky’s legs, jerking at them with all his strength.
The result was exceedingly funny.</p>

<p>Toplinsky threw out both hands, waved them
wildly, and attempted to fasten himself down with his
powerful leg muscles. But this time light gravity aided
the American, and he was able to shove the giant’s feet
from under him. For a second Toplinsky was a bundle
of flying arms and legs threshing the air and he fell in
half a dozen directions. Joan, looking back, laughed
outright.</p>

<p>To be laughed at was the crudest punishment that
could be inflicted on the egotistical scientist. He let
out a bellow like a bull, and made a desperate,
thoughtless effort to stand up. The effort proved a
contortion of muscles in the wrong way, and he
sprawled in every direction again.</p>

<p>There was now no mercy in Epworth’s battles with
this man, and he was not overlooking an opportunity.
The first assault by the giant had taught him caution,
and now he moved slowly, thoughtfully. He was not
a man to draw a weapon carelessly on a man but he
was fighting for the lives of three people. He could not
afford to be squeamish. This was not like fighting on
the earth. He was physically outclassed.</p>

<p>Drawing his gun he brought the butt down on
Toplinsky’s head with all the force he had in his arm.</p>

<p>The giant was like an ox but the blow knocked him
out.</p>

<p>By this time Toplinsky’s men were stumbling over
each other to get to the fight, and pausing only for a
second to get the direction in which Joan and Billy
had gone, Epworth adopted Toplinsky’s method of
travel, and departed with a hop-skip-and-jump. The
progress he made was startling, and very soon he was
some distance away from the pirate band, and had
caught up with his companions.</p>

<p>“Do this,” he instructed. “Make it snappy. The
giant will be after us shortly.”</p>

<p>But again Toplinsky proved wise. When he discovered
that his companions could not master the art
of advance, he did not give chase. He knew now that
Epworth had a gun, and he was not anxious to push
a contest where the gun would have to be used. Thus
the three fugitives reached the mountains, and found
refuge in a cave, the entrance of which they blocked
with a large boulder.</p>

<p>“We’re sitting pretty now,” Billy remarked as he
rolled a cigarette, “but I am wondering what we are
going to eat and drink?”</p>

<p>The three Americans looked gravely out at the
dreary waste land. Not a sprig of green grass, not a
tree, not a sign of a spring—only barren white sand
dunes, climbing cliffs with crater-like holes in them,
and the food and water supply in the hands of men
who would kill.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XIV<br /><br />A Moon Army</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">The fact that they were physically comfortable
gave the Americans much satisfaction. They were
not too warm, and not cold. Toplinsky had been exceedingly
wise in selecting a deep shaded valley for
his colonizing idea, and after being two days of twenty-four
hours’ duration each, in a cave hidden from the
giant, Epworth concluded that Toplinsky’s scheme of
heating the valley by solar heat during the long night
and withdrawing the heat during the day might prove
successful, and that the air created by firing the projectiles
from the earth might in the course of time,
provided the bombardment continued indefinitely,
spread all over the face of the moon.</p>

<p>He did not attempt to get food and water during
this time, feeling sure that Toplinsky would keep a
careful watch, but after forty-eight hours the necessity
for water prompted action. He started out with Billy
to go to the Aerolite and attempt to steal into the
storeroom. They waited until the Aerolite seemed in
a state of rest, and its crew, Epworth reasoned, slept.</p>

<p>They had to be careful of footsteps because of the
Lunar attraction.</p>

<p>Like shadows they flitted across the open space, and
approached the airship, gaining the sides of the vessel,
they thought, without being observed. Here they
paused and Epworth placed his hand on the steel
ladder-steps, and glanced around. He was startled at
the clearness of the light. Men on guard would have
had little trouble seeing them come across the open
space. He shuddered. It would be easy for Toplinsky
to prepare an ambush for him; and as easy for him
to keep an eye on the cave.</p>

<p>From where he stood he could readily make out the
mouth of their hiding place.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness,” he murmured, “he doesn’t know
where we are hiding.”</p>

<p>He looked up at the deck of the plane. It was entirely
too still—suspiciously quiet. If he was preparing
to receive an enemy in secret he would maintain just
such a stillness. He would lead his victim on.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was board the Aerolite or starve.</p>

<p>With a cat-like step he climbed the ladder, gun in
hand, his knife in his mouth. At the balcony there was
a dark shadow. Instantly he covered it with his gun.</p>

<p>“Not a whimper!” he commanded in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Sh—h.” It was Michael Strauss, and he put up his
gun. “Toplinsky is expecting you just inside of the
door,” Michael continued. “I let myself down from
the balcony on top of the airship when I saw you
coming. He has purposely left the door open in the
hope that you will push it, and walk in.”</p>

<p>“We must have food,” Epworth stated tersely. “Also
water.”</p>

<p>“Slip back down the ladder, and go around
to the rear of the ship. I also have been waiting for
you, and have dropped several days’ supplies on the
ground. Take this, and come back the day after tomorrow,
when the coast is clear. By that time Toplinsky
will think that you have discovered other means
of getting food. Then you can keep coming back until
you are well supplied. Fortunately Toplinsky has not
yet discovered that I aided you when you were on
board.”</p>

<p>“Michael, you’re a fine sport,” Epworth whispered.
“Some day I will find a means of returning this great
favor. By your efforts you save the lives of three
people.”</p>

<p>“It is enough for me to know that,” Michael replied
quietly.</p>

<p>Epworth squeezed his hand, and dropped down
the ladder.</p>

<p>They found the supplies where Michael had designated,
and returned with them to their cave. Two days
later they made another trip, and again Michael aided
them. They kept this up for over a week, and during
this time Toplinsky and his men were busily engaged
in building a large house, which they supposed he
would turn into a warehouse as well as a barracks for
his men. Another force erected the solar heater on the
rim of the northern range of mountains.</p>

<p>At the end of six days, they had enough food and
water on hand to last three months, and as a final inspiration
Epworth got Michael to send down material
to use in the construction of gliders. With this material
they worked for another day, building three small
gliders propelled with foot-power and elevated by
running down hill.</p>

<p>The gliders were, of course, a venture, constructed
along original lines, but when Epworth tried them
out the night they were finished, he found that he
could easily float them in the air against the slight
gravity of the moon.</p>

<p>Quite pleased with their idea, and determined to
fly over Toplinsky’s camp the next day, they retired
in high spirits to sleep like rocks until quite late.
They were awakened by loud shouts and the noise of
exploding guns. When they rushed to the mouth of
their cave a strange spectacle met their gaze.</p>

<p>Swarming across the space north between the Aerolite
and the northern range of mountains an army of
mammoth cricket-shaped things were approaching.
They came in military formation, hopping with steady,
persistent leaps, measured to an exactness that enabled
each company to land and leave the ground at
the same time and in perfect unison. Each cricket
was as large as a man, and possessed six legs and two
long sharp antennas extending straight out from the
eyes. They traveled on the four rear legs, and held
long, sharp, steel-pointed lances in their front
antennas and two front legs. Their backs were hard
and black, and Epworth wondered as he noted the
strength of the coating if they were bullet proof.</p>

<p>That they were possessed of a rare degree of intelligence
was evidenced by their military approach, and
their splendid formation. That they could use these
weapons the Americans did not doubt, and congratulated
themselves that they were not the objects of
attack.</p>

<p>When he turned his eyes toward the Aerolite, Epworth
saw that Toplinsky was already fighting. Many
of his men were backed against the half-built wall of
the house, and were sharp-shooting with their rifles.</p>

<p>“If Toplinsky had only a few projectiles of liquid
air,” Billy observed regretfully, “he might teach these
Things something about war.”</p>

<p>“As it is he and his men are going to have the fight
of their lives,” Epworth replied soberly.</p>

<p>“Look at their leaders!” Joan exclaimed in amazement.
“They have some kind of marvelous growth on
their backs.”</p>

<p>Epworth, who never went without a pair of binoculars,
put the glasses to his eyes, and studied the
things she pointed out. The things he saw on top of
the crickets were more wonderful than the huge insects.</p>

<p>They were men-shaped humps riding on the back
of the crickets. At least their small bodies, legs and
arms were shaped like men but their heads were
enormous knotty projections with eye openings an
inch and a half in diameter.</p>

<p>“Do I see properly?” the young man inquired, handing
the glasses to Joan. “Do I see some kind of a man
with a metallic-like head?”</p>

<p>Joan examined the riders thoughtfully. They were
now approaching with incredible rapidity and she
got a better view of them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XV<br /><br />Battling with Crickets</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">“They are little men with some kind of a device over
their heads,” she asserted with assurance. “And
they are acting as the general and commanding officers
of the cricket army.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it,” Epworth declared excitedly. “They
are wearing a headgear to protect them from this outside
atmosphere that has been suddenly sent down
upon them. At least——”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they do not know that there is an atmosphere,”
Billy argued, “Maybe they live some place
where there is air, and think that they must be prepared
to travel through a world where there is no air.”</p>

<p>“G’wan,” Joan snorted slangily. “Do you mean to
suggest that they came here from some other world?”</p>

<p>“Probably they came up out of some of the holes in
the moon. I have heard it suggested that the moon is
hollow, and that there is a possibility of air inside.”</p>

<p>Before Joan could reply to this the battle began.
Toplinsky, like a good general, waited until the moon
insects were quite close, and then poured seven volleys
from repeating rifles into their ranks. The crickets
went down by hundreds. The questions as to whether
or not their backs were bullet proof was answered.</p>

<p>Just for a second the lines wavered; then there rent
the air a loud musical chirp. It went up and down the
various lines of cricket soldiers in waves. It was not
unpleasant to hear. In fact, it was accompanied by
notes. But it was none the less deadly and demoralizing
to the colonists, and sent a chill down the backs
of the three Americans, safe in their cave retreat.</p>

<p>Toplinsky shouted in his shrillest voice; from far in
the rear of the cricket army came an answering call. To
the unbounded wonder of both the Americans and the
colonists this answer came back in English.</p>

<p>“Surrender, earth men,” it called out in broken but
understandable English, “or we will wipe you out, and
not leave a single person living.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky’s answer was a shower of lead in the direction
of the voice. Again hundreds of crickets fell;
again the ranks closed in strong formation and came
forward as if there had been no deaths.</p>

<p>“These Things do not fear death,” Joan whispered
in awe. “They do not know what it is. They are just
big insects.”</p>

<p>They were coming slowly now but surely, treading
softly forward as if sneaking up on an enemy. To the
observers in the cave it looked as if they were so
many cats preparing to jump on a mouse. The colonists
fired desperately. Michael, who seemed to be leading
one end of the pirate gang, got a small machine gun
out of the storehouse, and began to mow them down
like a health officer doping flies. Still they came on—seemingly
irresistible, holding their sharp prongs outward,
and leaping with invisible movements with their
small thin legs.</p>

<p>Now they were fighting the colonists hand to hand.
It was apparent however that one colonist was more
than a match for ten crickets, and they were thrown
back on their second rank, only to be pushed forward
again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was patent that in time the little
band of colonists would be wiped out. Epworth was
of the opinion that the crickets would eat them. This
however was merely a hunch.</p>

<p>“I do not like those colonists,” he remarked, “but
the idea of human beings being cornered by enormous
strange insects and turned into a lunch does not appeal
to me. These Things look as if they may be of
the Orthoptera family but one cannot tell. I’m for
butting in.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” Billy agreed, “but how?”</p>

<p>“Follow me and we will see.”</p>

<p>Epworth ran to his newly constructed glider,
fastened the plane around his shoulders, and started
down the mountainside for a take-off.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” Joan inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“We must get to the Aerolite storeroom, and see if
we can unlimber some of the heavy gas guns and nitroglycerine
weapons. No time to lose.”</p>

<p>All three ran down the mountainside, got into the
air, and with the bicycle motors they had attached to
the planes directed their course to the Aerolite. Finally
they landed on top of the machine as gently as birds.
Entering the storeroom, the two men hastily put together
one of the large nitroglycerine guns, a big
cannon, and a powder gatlin gun Toplinsky had
brought along as a measure of defense. These weapons
they rolled to the side of the machine from whence
came the attack, and both began a bombardment of
the cricket army.</p>

<p>The result was startling.</p>

<p>At the first tremendous roar of the cannon, the
crickets came to a dead stop. Not since untold ages had
such a noise been heard on the face of the moon. Here
was all stillness—a terrifying quietude, not even the
chirp of a bird or the whirr of a snake. The sudden
explosion, as if the entire face of the moon was bursting,
and with it was blowing into pieces a large number
of crickets, frightened not only the crickets but
the little men who were riding on their backs, and
with one movement they turned and fled.</p>

<p>But as they departed they carried with them a number
of colonists as prisoners. Epworth shuddered as
he saw the colonists captured. Their fate was plainly
apparent. They would not even get the treatment of
a fat missionary. There would be no preliminaries.
They would be dragged into a hole in the moon and
eaten.</p>

<p>The two Americans fired another shot at the disappearing
insects, saw them go forward with great
bounds like grasshoppers, and finally disappear over
the top of the highest northern mountains. It was
incredible the swiftness with which they left the scene
of battle.</p>

<p>Supposing that Toplinsky would still be antagonistic
the Americans left the top of the Aerolite with
leaps that lifted them into the air, and soon were again
hidden in their cave.</p>

<p>“Sup—pose the crickets come back,” Joan said fearfully
as she removed the shoulder straps of her glider.
“They seemed highly intelligent, and were led by
minds that did not think of defeat. If they return they
will have a large increase in number, and——”</p>

<p>Billy drew his finger across his throat, and pointed
at the colony camp.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXVI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XVI<br /><br />Billy Disappears</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">They were not in the cave over an hour when
Michael appeared. He was quite nervous, and
greatly troubled.</p>

<p>“We want you, Mr. Epworth,” he greeted, “to come
and take command of the camp. Toplinsky has been
carried off by the huge moon monsters of insect creation,
and we are not able to contend with what may
come up.”</p>

<p>“But suppose Toplinsky escapes and returns,” Joan
objected. “Our heads will not be worth much.”</p>

<p>“We have threshed that out, and the camp will, as
one man, force him to treat you kindly, and as an
equal. In fact, they say that the Americans won the
day for them against these Lunar enemies, and that
hereafter they cannot afford to trust everything to the
general. He will have to divide authority with you,
and agree to your terms.”</p>

<p>“Very well. We will come. Billy, remain here and
put things in shape to keep. We will not go off and
leave ourselves without supplies in case we have to
come back. Later we will return and all of us will go
back to the Aerolite. I also think that we must band
together to protect ourselves from all kinds of Lunar
enemies.”</p>

<p>Accompanied by Joan, Epworth entered his glider
and flew over to the Aerolite. They were greeted as
conquering heroes, and Epworth was immediately put
in charge of the camp. First, he established a strong
military organization with Michael as the commanding
officer, and arranged to materialize all the stores
of the Aerolite into defense weapons. When this work
was completed he created a council of five, and had
the colonists elect the members. This council was to
be the governing power, and he bound the pirates by
firm obligations to force Toplinsky to obey the orders
of this council.</p>

<p>With this accomplished he and Joan returned, well
satisfied, to their cave, leaving the entire membership
of the colony housed in the Aerolite so that if any
danger arose they could fly out of it.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, Billy!” Epworth shouted as he landed
lightly in front of the cave. “Snap out of it. We’re
going to go to the Aerolite. From this on, I think it
will be perfectly safe for us.”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and with a frown on his face
the young man divested himself of his glider, and
entered the cave.</p>

<p>Billy was not there, and his glider and all their
supplies were missing.</p>

<p>“W-w-what do you suppose happened to him?”
Joan inquired nervously, looking over Epworth’s
shoulder. “We were not gone over two hours, and yet
all of our supplies are gone—things that it took us ten
days to cart from the Aerolite. Looks as if ghosts had
been here.”</p>

<p>“Billy could not have moved them in this time,”
Epworth reasoned. “Something has happened to him.”</p>

<p>With the carefulness of a detective he began to
search the cave for evidence that would lead to the
direction in which Billy had gone. Every article they
had left in the way of supplies was gone. Even the
water jars were missing, and the only evidence of the
presence of enemies consisted of numerous small lines
in the sand of the floor. These lines looked like finger
marks. Billy’s foot prints, close to the point where
they had last seen his glider, were plainly evidenced,
but Epworth could not ascertain the direction he had
gone when he left. In fact, reasoning by his foot tracks,
he went up into the air, and he could not have gone
far in this direction because the top of the cave would
have stopped him.</p>

<p>Running back in the cave the young American
looked for evidence that would indicate that the small
finger tracks had gone that way. The back of the cave,
which they had not previously investigated, ran up
against a big pile of boulders and seemingly came to
an end.</p>

<p>“These tracks,” he finally said to Joan in a hushed
voice, “were probably made by those cricket-like
animals that attacked the Aerolite. If so——”</p>

<p>“They have twelve hands and no feet. With their
front hands they hold their weapons, and are also able
to use their four leg hands as feet and hands.” She
shivered. “It’s ghostly; it gives me the all-overs. They
came in here, captured Billy and disappeared in the
air.”</p>

<p>“I reason the same way,” Epworth agreed. “But
what are we going to do? We must do something to
help Billy.”</p>

<p>“Find out where they went and follow them.”</p>

<p>“Rather large order.” Epworth grinned dryly.
“There may be two million of them.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t go back into the cave,” Joan insisted
heatedly; “consequently they must have come up
around the mountains and slipped up on Billy.”</p>

<p>“Then they discovered him while we were at the
Aerolite, and have taken him to the northern range of
hills—where they carried Toplinsky.”</p>

<p>“Sounds likely.”</p>

<p>“Then it is me for the north. You go to the Aerolite,
and wait until I come back. I will make a thorough
search in my glider.”</p>

<p>“Not me. Where you go I go also. I am not taking
any chances of being separated from you in this
strange world. To be candid I don’t like these cricket
Things; and I don’t like the pigmy men who ride on
them and direct them in battle.”</p>

<p>“Have it your way. We will communicate with
Michael, and tell him to keep a constant watch, and
that at the first approach of the enemies get into the
air with the Aerolite. I am quite sure that in the airship
they will be safe.”</p>

<p>But when they spoke to Michael and informed him
that they contemplated going in search of Billy and
Toplinsky, the young guard demurred.</p>

<p>“Suppose you discover them prisoners in the hands
of a large army?” he suggested. “What will you do?”</p>

<p>“Scheme to free them. I certainly will not leave
human beings at the mercy of myriads of cricket-shaped
Things that may eat them.”</p>

<p>Equipped with food to last for a week, armed with
tear guns and automatics, and carrying with them two
large air helmets which they thought they might need
in case they were forced to seek high altitude, they
entered their gliders, and sailed toward the range of
mountains in the north. There were many tall peaks
ahead of them—mountains that stuck their noses high
into the dark sky, and which Epworth knew were
pitted with enormous craters.</p>

<p>When they got to the point where the cricket army
had disappeared, they circled around for half an hour
studying the country with their glasses. In front of
them, near the range of mountains which they encircled,
they saw another large valley, almost circular.
Beyond this valley came a rugged foothill country and
further on there was an immense peak, eighteen thousand
feet high.</p>

<p>Epworth jockeyed his glider close to his sister.</p>

<p>“According to the maps of the earth astronomers,”
he explained, “that mountain is the Crater Agrippa.
I’ve got a hunch that our crickets dwell inside of that
crater. It is deep down, over five miles, to the bottom,
and if my reasoning is sound the air in the bottom of
the crater is heavier than on the surface of the moon.
It would, it seems, make an ideal place for Things like
these crickets to live. They are thin of body, elongated
in form, spread out broadly, light in weight but
strongly muscled, and the gravity of the moon would
about fit their physical shapes.”</p>

<p>“Granting all your science, what are you going
to do?”</p>

<p>“Go to the bottom of that crater. If we find nothing
there we will search among these innumerable small
pits that we see everywhere.”</p>

<p>Joan shuddered.</p>

<p>“Go into the darkness of all these holes?”</p>

<p>She was terrified at the thought.</p>

<p>“Certainly—if we fail to find our friend above the
hollows that we know are inside of the moon.”</p>

<p>“Hollows inside of the moon?” She dropped her
eyes. She was startled, made afraid. The idea of
crawling around on her hands and knees hunting for
lunar crickets in dark holes was terrifying. “And—and—we
must crawl in——?”</p>

<p>“I am more cheerful. These crickets were led by
pigmy men. It is not likely that the pigmies live in
holes, although, I am free to confess that I would
naturally expect the crickets to be crawling around in
dark places.”</p>

<p>With a slight shrug of her shoulders, Joan turned
her glider toward the peak that Epworth had declared
was the Crater Agrippa. In two minutes Epworth was
in the lead. They were both determined, but their
hearts were beating furiously.</p>

<p>What dangers would they meet deep in the bowels
of the moon? What kind of life could they expect to
find? Was Billy alive or dead? Had they taken him to
join Toplinsky or would they have to make separate
hunts for the two men?</p>

<p>To gain the summit of the high peak they had to go
up in running jumps. They would run several steps,
then jump into the air, and pedal to gain height. In
this way they finally got to a point where they could
look down into a deep crater.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXVII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XVII<br /><br />“Something’s Got Me”</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Down, down—on into a pit of bottomless depth,
circling slowly, cautiously, and nosing steadily.
Now they could look upward, and see the stars shining
out of a black sky, as if they were in a deep well; and
still they descended past steep cliffs of white rock,
walls as smooth as a rifle bore; then into a region of
jagged walls, and stone of volcanic ore; past innumerable
dark holes that pierced gloomily into dreadful,
mysterious places under the ground; whirling all the
time within the grasp of a crater ten miles in diameter.</p>

<p>Suddenly it grew dark. The sun, in throwing its
light into the crater had been cut off by the slight
rotations of the moon. It was a gloom that caused Joan
to close her eyes, and hold her breath.</p>

<p>Would they never reach the bottom?</p>

<p>Miles dropped away, and still the air held them up,
and they sailed in circles. That his companion might
follow, Epworth turned on his flash light, and attached
it to the wing of his glider.</p>

<p>It was a flight like Mercury speeding as a messenger
through inscrutable space. Two little planes, with
operators wearing air helmets that dimmed vision,
were slipping softly, silently, into the bowels of the
moon, hunting a strange land in an unknown world.</p>

<p>It necessitated matchless courage, and steady nerves.
These two went on seeking to save.</p>

<p>They went on until complete darkness engulfed
them—a darkness that grew steadily murky, oppressive,
frightful. Still they continued. Where Epworth
led, Joan was determined to follow. Would they ever
be able to climb out? Would their small, inefficient
gliders, the invention of a moment, notwithstanding
their propelling power, be able to ascend that dizzy
height? True that when they entered, the air was so
rare that they had to wear air helmets, and that now
they put them aside to find heavier and better breathing;
but the space was limited, there was no wind to
get beneath the plane and elevate it; the whole mysterious
dark world was as still as death, and as creepy
as the grave.</p>

<p>Joan was on the verge of screaming aloud. Epworth
was beginning to get nervous.</p>

<p>He looked down, and thought he saw a light. Before
he could settle his mind on this point he bumped
against the ground. It was a light shock, and he felt no
injury but it served to stop the flight of his glider.
The next moment Joan bumped into him and also
came to a stop. The contact came before he had an
opportunity to call out to her to be on guard.</p>

<p>“Julian! Julian!” she cried. “Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed,” he reassured. “I am here.”</p>

<p>Disengaging the plane from her shoulders, and leaving
the straps that held it tight on the wing, she advanced
toward him. When she came to him he was
stepping out of the glider.</p>

<p>“What now?” she inquired dryly. “We are in the
bottom of Mount Agrippa, and, if you will excuse the
slang, it certainly has a grip I do not like.”</p>

<p>“I believe I see a dim light off there,” he pointed
out with his index finger. “Do you see it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is an underground volcano,” she suggested.
“I feel warm.”</p>

<p>“Merely underground heat. Were it a volcano it
would be brighter. However we will not know unless
we investigate.”</p>

<p>Shifting his tear gun, which he had attached to his
belt, to a convenient place, and holding his flash light
in his hand, the young man led the way cautiously.
They were on a level, ashy floor, in which their feet
buried at each step; but without pausing to investigate
the character of the soil they strode forward
steadily. It was a longer walk than he thought it
would be, and presently they became aware that there
was a roof over their heads—a roof of earth. When Joan
made this discovery she was for turning back.</p>

<p>“No,” Epworth decided. “The light ahead is getting
stronger. Presently we will be somewhere.”</p>

<p>This conclusion was not justified by what they saw
but the light began to get brighter, and after a time
they could see each other.</p>

<p>“It is spooky,” Joan breathed out, lagging behind a
little. “Absolutely unhuman. There is no sun, there
is no heat, but we can see. What causes it?”</p>

<p>“It is a phosphorescent glow emanating from the
walls of the crater,” Julian replied thoughtfully.
“That is the only ex——”</p>

<p>“Help! Help, Julian!” Joan screamed. “Something’s
got me. Something——”</p>

<p>Her utterances were cut off by two long, thin, bone-like
tentacles twisting around her neck. At the same
second Epworth was attacked.</p>

<p>The young man however was as swift as an eagle,
and had been ever on the alert. He recognized the
fact instantly that the crickets were upon them, and
that he could not fight them with his flash light. Dropping
the light, which was attached to his clothing by
a cord, he drew his tear gun and swept a stream of
tear gas into the face of the Things around him. The
gas stopped them instantly, and with an agile bound
he darted to Joan’s side. She was in the hands of six
crickets, their bodies dimly visible in the phosphorous
light. They were standing on their hind legs, and were
making a saddle of their middle extremities while
pushing Joan into the saddle with their front hands.</p>

<p>Epworth’s tear gun proved highly efficient. It gassed
the two who made the saddle. This caused the other
four to drop the girl. Instantly the young man shot
the tear gas above Joan’s head into their faces, caught
the girl and dragged her to him. A stream of the insects
came at him, chirping savagely. Darting to the
side of the cave he carried his companion with him.</p>

<p>The effort seemed useless, for now his retreat was
cut off by an army of the hopping monsters. The only
thing left him was to back against the wall, and use
his tear gun. This he did.</p>

<p>The crickets, with their singing chirps, became
suddenly appalling with their din. Epworth shuddered,
side stepped, and undertook to push Joan behind
him in order to protect her. The move was fatal.
Stumbling over a boulder, he fell backward head over
heels into a hole in the wall.</p>

<p>In a desperate effort to save Joan he twisted her in
his arms, and placed her above his body with a view
of making a cushion of his body when they struck
terra firma. How far it was to the bottom of this hole
he had no way of ascertaining. It might be two thousand
feet deep. These moon holes were tremendous
affairs. All he knew was that he was falling and that
the crickets were sending out musical notes of
triumph.</p>

<p>However, since coming to the moon he had discovered
that he could jump a long ways and land
without being hurt; that he could even leap off a high
cliff without danger to life or limb, and now he found
that they were not falling fast, and this gave him encouragement.</p>

<p>They struck bottom abruptly. Epworth was jarred
and bruised some, but not seriously hurt although he
lay as if stunned for several seconds. Joan was unhurt,
and during the descent had regained her full faculties,
which were leaving her under the choking power of
the cricket tentacles. The second they were still she
twisted out of Epworth’s arms, caught his flash light,
which had been knocked out of circuit by the fall,
and began to work with it hysterically. In a brief
period she had it in action and was throwing a narrow
stream of light around.</p>

<p>They had landed on a large ledge suspended over
a bottomless chasm, and behind them there was a big
tunnel. As they were dangerously close to the edge
of the precipice she staggered to her feet and pulled
Epworth away from the danger point.</p>

<p>“My,” she whispered, “I thought we were goners.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for Epworth to speak she stepped
to the tunnel and shot her light ray into its gloomy
depth. For several seconds the light pierced the gloom
for fifteen feet, flickered, and died out. The battery
had been exhausted, and now they were in murky,
terrifying gloom with a deep chasm on three sides.
In dying despair the girl covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>Epworth, breathing heavily, sat up.</p>

<p>“Let me have the flash light,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“It has gone out for good,” she replied in a hopeless
voice, at the same time handing him the tube. “I can’t
get a ray out of it.”</p>

<p>Epworth fumbled with it for a moment in the dark.</p>

<p>“The batteries are dead,” he explained. “How foolish
not to have looked into this before we started.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” Joan moaned. “Lost in the center
of the moon, and no light to direct our steps.”</p>

<p>“Never say die,” the young man encouraged. “Take
my hand. It is my left. I am holding my automatic
in my right.”</p>

<p>They groped forward. Action was at the moment
necessary to keep Joan from losing her mind. On and
on they stumbled. Each step they expected to plunge
heels-over-head into another deep chasm but persistently
they followed the twisting meanderings of the
passage.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joan stopped and sniffed the air, trembling
violently.</p>

<p>“There—there—is something alive in this place,”
she muttered feebly. “I—I—smell something awful—horrid,
and—and—I—feel—a—sinister—presence.”</p>

<p>Epworth sniffed with his nostrils. The scent was
now overpowering, musty, terrifyingly rotten.</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken about there being living
beings in here,” he protested. “That smell would indicate
that we have stumbled on the crickets’ graveyard.”</p>

<p>“Or, or, or,” Joan caught his hand convulsively to
keep from screaming, “their commissary department.
Maybe—maybe—living beings are confined here until
they rot, and are then eaten as food.”</p>

<p>Epworth could not suppress the shudder that swept
over him from head to foot.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXVIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><br />In the Chamber of Horrors</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">“It—it—is a chamber of horrors,” Joan gasped. “I
know there is a ghost in this place or some living
thing. I can feel it; I can hear a slight movement.”</p>

<p>Epworth strained his eyes in every direction. All
was murky darkness, Cimmerian gloom. If there was
anything living near, the darkness wrapped it in an
envelop impossible to penetrate.</p>

<p>“You are certainly mistaken,” he soothed. “There
is no living thing here. It couldn’t——”</p>

<p>He paused. There came the suspicion of a sound
to his ear. It was very soft. A rat could not move with
less noise; a cat in stepping would have sounded like
a cannon exploding. What could it be? Noiseless
crickets—a nest of young crickets expecting a mother?
The cavern seemed large and the air seemed pure
but that animals or things could live in such a place
seemed impossible. He voiced his thoughts.</p>

<p>“It is strange that there is air in here,” Joan admitted,
“and stranger yet that I should think that
there is life here. But this is a strange world. We never
saw a Thing on earth like these moon crickets. Nor
is there a pigmy on earth like the pigmies that rode
on the crickets; nor are there great hollows in the
earth where the air has congealed and left the outside
cold and airless. It is a different creation entirely.
Mercy! I see—I see—eyes staring at me from out the
darkness. Holy angels, protect me! There are three
of them, and they are running me crazy to look at
them.”</p>

<p>Her teeth chattered until Epworth could hear them,
and she buried her head in the young man’s shirt
front. Now he also saw the eyes. There were three—great
red lights that flared in the darkness. Two on a
level, and one in the center. The center eye was
enormous and terrifying to the extreme. Brave as he
was he shivered with terror. There was something so
ghostly, uncanny, about the Thing that his nerves
washed out.</p>

<p>Then it flashed by. A nasty-smelling Thing shot out
of the gloom; a Thing with a lizard-like, scaly body,
long legs and antennas; a Thing that carried a phosphorus
glow that plainly disclosed its proportions.
It went by them like a railroad train, an enormous
whirling, gliding animal that chilled them unto death.</p>

<p>Joan screamed at the top of her voice, and fell limp.
Epworth stumbled and fell forward on his face. Each
second they expected the Thing to pounce on them,
and mash them flat.</p>

<p>Then oblivion fell on both.</p>

<p>It seemed hours later that the two returned to consciousness.
They were on the same level, rocky floor,
lying side by side, and Epworth was holding his gun
in his hand. It had not been discharged.</p>

<p>When he made this discovery he rose quickly to
his feet. His first thought was of the evil-smelling
Thing that had appeared out of the darkness. Where
was it? Were there others back in this chamber of
horrors? Was the one he saw preparing another attack
on them?</p>

<p>He looked around with fearful eyes. He could not
see any signs of the animal. That did not mean that
it was not near. He thought that the Thing could
move with less noise than a cat, and with the swiftness
of an eel.</p>

<p>“W-w-what was it?” Joan stammered.</p>

<p>“I hope to high heaven I never find out,” Epworth
breathed fervently. “It was the most gosh-awful horror
that ever stirred my nerves. It has probably crawled
back in its hole, which must be down this chamber.
I hope it dies before I see it again. At least I am going
to go in the direction directly opposite from that
taken by the Thing—and I am going as fast as my slow
feet will let me.”</p>

<p>He sprang up, caught her hand, and ran hurriedly
down the chamber, stumbling over big rocks, and
against the sides of the tunnel in his desperate effort
to leave the spot.</p>

<p>He had no idea where he was going. For all he
knew he was going back the way he came. He was
getting away from that chamber of horrors as speedily
as possible.</p>

<p>They wandered on for an hour—two hours. There
was no end to the dark tunnel but they were moving
and getting farther and farther away from that hidden
monster; and they were going swiftly, without
thinking of falling into another chasm. In fact any
kind of a hole would have been preferable to this,
and they dared not stop.</p>

<p>Finally Joan looked ahead and saw a streak of light.</p>

<p>“Thank heavens,” she breathed. “At last we are
coming to the end of this horrible tunnel.”</p>

<p>Epworth did not reply. He was not so sure. On the
contrary he could not, by his greatest scientific legerdemain,
figure how they would ever get out of this
crater.</p>

<p>The end came abruptly—butting up against a pile
of large stones. There were large cracks between the
stones, and it was patent that intelligent hands had
placed them and not Nature. Some being or some intelligent
Thing had blocked up the passage purposely
with loose stones, to keep out the enormous
reptiles.</p>

<p>But the light was streaming through the cracks,
and the two were crazy to get to light again. If this
darkness enveloped them many hours longer they
would lose their minds. Both fell on the rocks with
one thought, and began to tear them aside.</p>

<p>When a crack large enough to see through was made
they drew back dismayed. The walls of the chamber
ahead were lighted by a stream of fiery lava, and there
seemed no prospect of escaping from their cavern
prison. However the dim light was preferable to the
intense gloom that pervaded the passage they were
in, and Epworth decided to dig in.</p>

<p>He attempted to survey the interior of the other
chamber but his view was shut off by the narrowness
of the opening, and again he fell to removing the loose
stones. Soon he had an opening large enough to push
through.</p>

<p>When they stepped into the chamber their hearts
jumped with surprise. Billy Sand and Herman Toplinsky
were lying on the floor near where they entered
with their hands bound, and their faces against the
floor. On a stone couch near them was a beautiful
little woman, no larger than a ten-year old girl. She
was splendidly formed, and her blonde hair was
wrapped around her body in a braid and fell almost
to her feet. She also was bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>With a leap Epworth was by Billy’s side, slashing
the cords that bound him. When Billy was free Epworth
released Toplinsky and the girl on the couch
in the same manner. When freed Toplinsky sat up
lazily and stretched his arms and legs.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, the beautiful Joan—the lady who hates
me,” he greeted amiably. “Pleased to meet you—truly
am—but before we make merry let us hurriedly get
away by the passage through which you entered. I
fear that we have very little time to lose. In fact——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a noise at the far end of
the chamber. Glancing in the direction they saw a
large stone rolled away, and thirty crickets, marching
in military formation, came in, stepping carefully
over the stream of lava. They carried sharp steel-pronged
spears, and it was apparent that their intentions
were not friendly.</p>

<p>They were led by five men and a woman. And such
a woman! Like the blonde girl on the couch she was
no larger than a ten-year old child but she was bewilderingly
beautiful although her flesh was copper
colored. Her hair, a deep blue black, was twisted
around her waist over a richly colored red breech
cloth. Otherwise she was naked. Her eyes, slightly
oblique, were slothful at times and at other times full
of fire, transforming her into a menacing dictator.
She was ornamented like a barbarous queen with
bracelets on her arms, and a crown of jewels on her
head.</p>

<p>The men who led the crickets were also copper
colored, and small in stature, well-formed except their
heads, which were just a trifle large for their bodies.
When Joan looked into their faces she closed her eyes.
The lines of the faces were badly wrinkled, the mouths
were contorted and there was a smirk of evil stamped
over them. That they were highly intelligent, however,
she was soon to learn.</p>

<p>The woman, whose head was better formed, spoke,
to their surprise, in broken English with a peculiar
pronunciation that caused them to bend their ears attentively
to comprehend.</p>

<p>“I am Carza, the queen of the moon.” She drew her
form proudly erect and stared arrogantly at the little
blonde girl on the couch. “You are aware of that
now, Moawha,” she continued addressing the girl.
“From this on you are my slave. Perhaps, a little later
I shall slay you, and be rid of your pretensions forever.”</p>

<p>She paused, shrugged her shoulders, and smiled
softly. It was not an angelic expression but it exhibited
her even, white teeth, and proved exceedingly
attractive to Toplinsky, and the others thought that
she was quite exquisite.</p>

<p>“You are earth men.” She turned imperiously to
Toplinsky. “You are wondering how I am able to
speak to you in your own language? It is simple. For
years our scientists have been getting peculiar words
out of the air, and recording them on their space
records. For a long time they could make little out of
the noises from space but in time they concluded
that they were hearing the people on the great world
around which our smaller planet revolves every
twenty-eight days. Were they correct in their surmise?”</p>

<p>She looked inquiringly at Toplinsky. He nodded in
the affirmative, and with the grace of a courtier.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, it is so, your most gracious majesty. We
are charmed to meet a lady of such distinction.”</p>

<p>Carza knitted her eyebrows slightly, and then smiled
sweetly at the giant.</p>

<p>“So they put their intellects to work, and gradually
worked out an understanding of things that you call
earthly as well as an ability to talk in your language.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful! Wonderful!” Toplinsky added. “Did
they also discover a way of sending to the earth?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Our instruments, it seemed, are not of a character
that will put us into direct communication. We can
hear but not send. However I do not understand how
you gained your liberty. I was told that you were
bound hand and foot, and that my people only waited
word from me to slay you.”</p>

<p>One of the copper leaders approached deferentially,
dropped to his knees, and began to speak to her in an
unknown tongue.</p>

<p>“So, so,” she mused when he had completed his explanation,
“there were only two men and Moawha
when you were left here as prisoners, and you have
been hatching a man and woman.” She smiled artfully,
and the smile was more disagreeable than a
threat. “Some of your friends have been able to follow
and have broken in to help you escape. Seize
them!”</p>

<p>She thundered the command shrilly, and drew
back to lean against the wall. The copper men, followed
by the crickets, sprang forward giving the
cricket chirp of command.</p>

<p>“Keep them off!” Epworth commanded harshly.
“They must not undertake to touch us.”</p>

<p>“Must not,” sneered Queen Garza. “A bold word,
Sir Earth Man. We shall see. Have at them, Noble
Tauran.”</p>

<p>The copper men and the crickets rushed in a body.
Epworth knocked down the leader with the butt of
his gun, and Toplinsky, seizing a large cricket by its
rear legs, swung the insect around his head, and
charged, knocking the copper men and crickets around
like marbles.</p>

<p>Queen Carza leaned negligently against the wall,
and dropped her chin nonchalantly into the palm of
her hand. These men had been reported to her to
be great fighters, and she loved fighters. She watched
with keen interest. Frequently she nodded her head as
if well satisfied.</p>

<p>Joan could not understand this satisfaction. The
crickets and the pigmy men were obviously unable to
do harm to the three earthmen. But the queen was
only waiting. When she discovered that her body
guard was facing inevitable defeat she chirped through
her teeth.</p>

<p>It was the musical chirp of the crickets, calling them
to battle. They came, swarming through the door and
surrounding Toplinsky and the two Americans like
locusts. Billy, because of his small stature (he was only
five five) went down quickly; Epworth fought aggressively
for several moments but his long, fast and strenuous
efforts in the cave without water had weakened
him temporarily, and finally he gave way, his feet
slipped, and a hundred crickets had him pinned to
the floor.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho, ho! The bantam fighter is down,”
Toplinsky roared with a laugh that sounded like a
fiend. “It is sad indeed. Some day we will renew that
interesting contest for Lady Joan’s favor. At present
however——”</p>

<p>He backed against the wall, and began to use his
arms like a windmill, pushing the crickets and pigmies
around like chaff. It seemed to the onlookers as if
flesh and blood could not battle in this manner. With
his pale blue eyes flashing fire, his long, shaggy hair
whirled back over the crown of his head, and his heavy
red beard twisting from right to left with each movement
of his head, he looked like a fiend.</p>

<p>Epworth, Joan and Billy, and the girl called
Moawha, by the queen, were bound and placed with
their backs to the wall, and still Toplinsky fought.
If his strength held out it seemed as if he would be
able to stand off a nation of crickets.</p>

<p>“Hold!”</p>

<p>The command came from the queen, and was accompanied
by a cricket chirp. Instantly her cohorts
ceased fighting, and Toplinsky, smiling as if in the
face of death, extended his hand, jerked a toga off
of one of the pigmies, and wiped the blood from his
forehead where he had been hit by a spear.</p>

<p>Pushing aside the crickets and soldiers Carza strode
fearlessly up to the giant, and stopped to gaze into his
face fascinated.</p>

<p>“You are a great fighter,” she said abruptly.</p>

<p>“I am,” Toplinsky agreed without modesty. “I am
the greatest fighter you ever saw, or ever will see.”</p>

<p>“Bend your head,” she commanded.</p>

<p>With a smile that displayed his huge teeth disagreeably
Toplinsky obeyed. The queen took the
cloth from his hands, cleaned the blood from his face,
and thrust the bloody rag into her waist band.</p>

<p>“I have been looking for a man of mighty valor—a
man like you. Yes, you have been the search of my
life. Come! Together we will go far. You will aid
me in destroying my enemies, and increase my power
over the whole world.”</p>

<p>“But how about me?” Toplinsky objected. “What
do I get?”</p>

<p>“You will become the husband of the queen, and
if I find that I love you as I think I shall, you will become
the leader above me.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky picked her up in his left hand, kissed
her, and put her back on the floor.</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say.”</p>

<p>“If you take that woman for your queen you must
slay thousands of innocent people,” Moawha broke
out passionately. “They are gentle, kind-hearted, and
constantly warred upon by these abominable crickets—who
eat them.”</p>

<p>Moawha also spoke in broken English but her words
were not as clear as those pronounced by the queen.</p>

<p>“I shall have your feet toasted in that nice little
stream of fire,” Carza said coldly, turning malevolently
on Moawha. “You are not interested in this.”</p>

<p>Her black eyes were flashing fiercely as she spoke
but they cleared instantly when she turned to Toplinsky.</p>

<p>“Yes, it pleases me. I shall make you king.”</p>

<p>“Ho, comrades!” Toplinsky called out to the little
men. “See that these Americans do not escape. Also
look after this strange little woman. Presently we shall
slay the two men but not the earth woman. Ha! ha!”</p>

<p>He laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>“Be sure to guard Moawha well,” the queen commanded,
recognizing as official the authority Toplinsky
was grasping. “She shall die during the crowning
ceremonies.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XIX<br /><br />The Knife Dance</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">After two days, during which they were fed on
water and dried fruit—a variety that the Americans
had never seen before—their captors entered the
prison, lifted them on to the backs of crickets, and
marched them along for hours through a vast underground
world, lighted by a phosphorescent glow, and
teeming with crickets. The insects displayed rare intelligence
in the way they lived. They had traffic regulations,
certain paths of progress, large stacks of food
guarded carefully by armed crickets, and constantly
added to and systematically given out, playgrounds of
peculiar construction, and places—or rather—spots
of—assemblage where they listened to each other chirp
as if they were singing.</p>

<p>The prisoners were hurried along so rapidly that
they could see very little of this life, and could only
marvel at its strangeness.</p>

<p>Finally they came to a large underground palace. It
was not a house but Nature had built large pillars
that extended upward several hundred feet. They
were composed of shining quartz interspersed with
uncut diamonds burned into the quartz by Nature.</p>

<p>As they entered through these portals they trod upon
a yellow floor that they soon discovered was panned
gold dust.</p>

<p>At the entrance the crickets turned them over to a
body guard of pigmy men—fifteen in number. The
pigmies cut the cords from around their feet, and
marched them into a large throne room with their
spears thrust against their sides and their hands tied
behind their backs. At the back end of the room was
a throne ostentatiously ornamented with gold and
glittering jewels. Seated side by side on the throne
were Toplinsky and Queen Carza.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho, ho, we meet again.” The giant looked
at Joan with a glare that caused her to shrink backward.
“My statuesque blonde, again, but I fear that I
cannot offer her very great inducement at present.
You are invited to take part in the ceremonies that
will make me king of the moon, and join me in power
with this lovely queen. Kneel to her!”</p>

<p>The last was whipped out like a lash, and Joan
dropped thoughtlessly on her knees, frightened at
the giant’s tone of voice. The other three prisoners,
however, stood firmly erect.</p>

<p>“I kneel to God only,” Epworth declared vigorously.
“If you wish to take up with a female murderess that
is your business, but we are Americans.”</p>

<p>Queen Carza’s slothful eyes glittered ominously.</p>

<p>“The first part of the program,” she remarked as if
Epworth had not spoken, “will consist of a dance by
the beautiful and accomplished Moawha, formerly
queen of the Selinites but now a mere dancing slave.
When the dance is finished we will eat some delicate
fruit gathered from the groves of her Land, and then—ah,
then, my dear, I will have your feet, and the feet
of these other prisoners, thrust into that smouldering
fire.”</p>

<p>She pointed at a small stream of lava that spluttered
softly over the rocky bottom of the cavern, and flowed
gently into a deep hole.</p>

<p>Joan dropped her head to repress a cry of alarm.
Was this woman an incarnate fiend that she loved to
torture unto death innocent girls?</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! We win,” Toplinsky exclaimed as if in
great admiration. “A fit mate for the greatest scientist
of the earth-world. We shall get along admirably. But
for the benefit of you Americans, who are going to
die presently—all of you except Joan whose death I
shall endeavor to have shifted to some remote period—I
will say that Queen Carza and I have some great
plans ahead. Already I have discovered that her people
are gifted and know much science. True they do not
live here but we will soon be at home with them.
Then we shall first conquer the moon. I understand
that there are about two million pigmies who give
allegiance to Moawha. We will capture them, and
make slaves of them although Carza has only an army
of fifty thousand soldiers. To capture them will be
easy with Moawha dead, and my knowledge of gunpowder
and gas. When we have destroyed them and
gained complete control over crickets and pigmies I
shall turn my attention to Capitalistic America. I have
always hated that country, and shall wipe it out. First
I will land my exploding projectiles on the City of
New York. Ah, ha, ho, ho!”</p>

<p>He paused and sneered evilly at Epworth, and the
American felt a cold chill pass over him. As a power
for evil he admitted that Toplinsky could be
monstrous.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, I laugh loudly! I roar with genuine amusement!
I wring my hands together with great pleasure!
I see consternation and terrible disaster sweep over
fair America. Secure in my moon kingdom I shoot deliberately,
quietly, when I will, and I direct my projectiles
by radio. When I say unto myself ‘today I
shall wipe out Chicago,’ that day I will do it; when
I look in the glass at the faces of myself and my beloved
queen and point at the map where there is now
the City of St. Louis, and say, ‘I will make a huge
telescope and tomorrow week you may watch that
City and see it go up in smoke.’ Ah ha, it is so. I,
Herman Toplinsky, the greatest man that ever lived,
have said, and what I have said I have said.”</p>

<p>“Let the dance proceed,” Queen Carza commanded,
placing her little copper hand affectionately on the
giant’s enormous hand, and dropping her head into
his lap. “I would see her dance the ‘Knife Dance’ for
the last time. I hear that the beautiful blond queen
is the most graceful dancer in our world. I wish to
discover if this is true. If she proves extraordinarily
artistic I may conclude to dance with her—or rather
against her.”</p>

<p>Epworth and Joan glanced at each other.</p>

<p>“She is quite capricious,” Joan observed in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“And as deadly as a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“I prefer the snake,” Billy put in. “In fact, I think
you basely slander the reptile.”</p>

<p>Moawha’s bonds were removed, a number of
crickets and pigmy soldiers moved up around her,
cleared a space before the throne, and encircled the
space. Before she began the dance she was handed a
long, sharp two-edged knife. The blade was ten or
twelve inches.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get hold of that knife,” Billy remarked
whimsically in a low voice.</p>

<p>Moawha flashed upon him an expressive glance, and
then began her pirouette mazes. With her long blond
hair sweeping around her like a cloak, she soon demonstrated
that if she had a moon-wide reputation as a
dancer she could maintain it. It was a strange, wonderful,
weird, mystical terpsichorean exhibition during
which she brandished the knife she held in a
seemingly reckless manner. Up to the throne, back
again, across the chamber, and each time that she
neared the throne her lithe form twisted gracefully,
somersaulted over the knife held in a dangerous manner,
and the knife flashed wickedly toward the queen.</p>

<p>“Ah, it is so,” Toplinsky suddenly burst out. “Me-thinks
that Queen Carza is wise in watching this dance
from an elevated platform. If the fair blond came close
enough I have an idea that her life would be a short
one, if not merry.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished his remark when Moawha
darted backward, flipped over with an athletic whirl,
dropped down behind Billy’s back, and whirled away.</p>

<p>But she had done much with that dexterous movement.
Her keen knife had slashed the bonds that
bound Billy.</p>

<p>“Keep your hands behind your back,” she whispered
to him. “Let them appear tied.”</p>

<p>Before Toplinsky or the queen discovered her intention
she made another dexterous whirl, turned a
somersault over Epworth’s head, landed behind him
and freed his hands. The next second she was whirling
away toward the throne. But this time she was a little
too slow. Toplinsky, who was quite observant, caught
her freeing Epworth.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, the little blond is——”</p>

<p>Like a cannon ball Epworth shot across the chamber,
and landed in front of Queen Carza.</p>

<p>“Call them off!” he hissed, seizing the queen by the
arm with a fierce, painful clutch. “Call them off, Toplinsky,
or this lady is going to be hurt.”</p>

<p>There was need of rapid action. Urged by the
pigmy officers the crickets were jumping forward directly
at Billy and Joan. Billy pulled his knife, and
with one sweep cut the cords around Joan’s wrists.</p>

<p>“Use your tear gun!” Epworth called out. “Joan,
you still have it in your belt.”</p>

<p>Joan remembered the gun, and acted. With a single
motion she swept a circle around her.</p>

<p>“Get my automatic,” she whispered to Billy. “This
promises to be interesting. It is also in my belt.”</p>

<p>“Tell the queen to order them back,” Epworth
again commanded.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his intention. Toplinsky
had previously braved the American’s gun, and he
responded to the threat. The queen obeyed him, and
the crickets slowly drew back as Queen Carza chirped
at them. Toplinsky made a move even in the face of
Epworth’s threat.</p>

<p>“Slow down, Toplinsky!” Epworth growled. “Not
a move or your snake-like queen is going to begin to
cry out loud.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky sneered a little. By this time he had regained
his composure, and was preparing to leap on
Epworth. When he noticed the glare in the young
American’s eyes he slumped back. Epworth did not
realize it but many thoughts were racing through the
giant’s mind. Suppose Epworth should strangle the
queen? He shivered. He really did not think that Epworth
would commit such an act but if he did he
would be in more danger than Epworth and his
friends. With Queen Carza to aid him he would soon
be in complete control of the moon-world; without
her the crickets and pigmies would kill him instantly.
He had lorded it over them quite harshly during the
few days he had been at liberty and in power, and he
had escaped death at their hands only recently. Now
he realized that the crickets and pigmies did not like
him. He had ruthlessly killed too many of them. True
they did not understand what death was but they
knew enough to realize that this big giant did not
hesitate to wipe them out.</p>

<p>“Go easy, Epworth,” he said soberly. “You are
standing on dynamite. Perhaps we can ar——”</p>

<p>He was temporizing, preparing for a treacherous
attack, and Epworth knew it.</p>

<p>“I am going easy as long as you keep off your dogs
of war but you are not going to act funny.”</p>

<p>“So far so good,” Billy called out, “but where are
we going—and how?”</p>

<p>It was a problem. For the moment they seemed to
be on top—they had their enemies tied. But this could
not last. They were still in the center of the great
Crater Agrippa, buried alive amid thousands of
crickets that would eat them if they got a chance,
with every avenue of escape seemingly closed, and
long, dark, terrifying tunnels between them and the
open air.</p>

<p>Joan breathed a breath of despair. Escape seemed
impossible. They could not march the queen through
phalanx after phalanx of armed crickets and intelligent
pigmy men. Any second a number could sneak
up in their rear, or drop upon them out of one of the
dark holes over their heads. Yet this seemed to be the
only way out.</p>

<p>But in what direction was <em>out</em>?</p>

<p>Epworth was asking himself that question fearfully.
There were four directions, and innumerable
caverns penetrating the lighted chambers. Only one
of these passageways would lead back to their gliders.</p>

<p>He looked around at the frowning spear-tubes of
the crickets apprehensively.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XX<br /><br />Mysterious Cavern Lamps</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Epworth surveyed the chamber carefully. Behind
the throne, about three hundred feet distant, he
saw one of the innumerable holes that pierced the
crater in all directions. There were few crickets between
the throne and this hole, and he inwardly decided
that it would be the best way out of the dilemma.</p>

<p>But he did not fool himself. He realized that once
inside of that hole he would again be in a corridor of
death and darkness.</p>

<p>“Still,” he cogitated, “there is no possible chance
of escaping in any other way. We will at least be
temporarily freed of cricket masters.”</p>

<p>“Follow me,” he urged in a low voice, “and, Billy,
be sure to bring the little girl. Joan can look out for
herself.”</p>

<p>Lifting Queen Carza in his arms, holding her
pressed tightly against his chest with his right arm,
and keeping a tear gun against her head, he slid from
the throne, and ran hurriedly across the chamber.</p>

<p>“Stop him!” Toplinsky roared in a loud voice.
“St——”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Toplinsky, if you want to keep this girl
whole. If you keep your mouth shut I promise you
that she shall not be hurt.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky quieted down, and waved the crickets
and pigmies back. This enabled the four to gain the
dark passage. Unhesitatingly Epworth plunged into
the yawning darkness. As he and his companions disappeared
Queen Carza sent out a wild shout. She was
being dragged along with little regard for her queenly
disposition, and she was angry; not afraid. Wicked
though she was, she knew no fear.</p>

<p>Her shout was answered by a squealing sound from
her pigmy soldiers, and scarcely were they inside of
the hole when four pigmies dashed in to aid their
queen. They leaped upon the backs of Joan, Billy,
and Moawha. This caused Joan to send out a cry of
alarm.</p>

<p>Epworth turned to go to Joan’s assistance. He could
see the pigmies plainly, although in the darkness they
could not see him. As he wheeled, Queen Carza
wriggled out of his arms, and started to run. Epworth
did not stop her. He wanted to assist Joan; he did not
wish to injure the queen. Calmly he permitted the
queen to escape.</p>

<p>But Joan did not need his help. Throwing off the
pigmy with an effort she darted back into the cave.
By this time the struggle had carried all of them back
into the darkness, and they were hammering away
at each other in the gloom. At least the Americans
were in the darkness, but soon the pigmies demonstrated
that they could see. This was another surprise
to Epworth but he had not time to hunt an explanation
at the moment.</p>

<p>Billy, at the outset, knocked his man out and turned
to aid Moawha. This was hard to do as he could not
distinguish her from the other pigmies in the gloom.
The pigmies took advantage of this, and leaping on
the girl began to drag her back to the throne room.</p>

<p>“Help!” she screamed, and Billy rushed to her aid,
pulling her away from the pigmies who held her.</p>

<p>At this moment the crickets came crowding in from
the throne room.</p>

<p>“Run for it!” Epworth shouted.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Moawha answered a little wildly. “Not
yet. You will be lost in the cave. Wait for me, and
keep the crickets back.”</p>

<p>While they did not understand her purpose, Epworth
and Billy stood up side by side to fight. They
were now far back in the cave and the gloom was so
dense they could barely see; but they knew that the
crickets were advancing. They could hear their silent,
snoopy hands creeping softly over the stones.</p>

<p>Moawha ran up to Epworth, and slammed something
over his head.</p>

<p>“Adjust it to your eyes,” she whispered. “Hasten,
and then rush the crickets to stop them, while I cover
the heads of the others.”</p>

<p>Epworth was too surprised to speak. A second and
he was in terrible darkness, thinking that they would
be lost in a hole that wound around in gloom forever;
when Moawha left him he could see in front of him
a red world—Joan was red, Billy was red, Moawha was
red; the crickets, stealing up out of the darkness to
leap upon them, were red.</p>

<p>He did not pause to inquire the explanation. Leaping
forward he crashed into the crickets with his automatic,
showering surprise and fear at them. There
were only a few, and when they heard the awful
roar of his gun they fled backward to wait for their
companions.</p>

<p>“Come,” Moawha cried. “They will be on us in a
moment in great numbers.”</p>

<p>Recklessly they fled down the dark passage—dark no
longer; but now a stream of crimson and a flash of
red. Presently they came to three intersections. It
was no time to choose. Behind them came the musical
chirps of the crickets, and the whistles of the pigmy
men. They darted into the left hand passage, and
hurried onward. When they had gone some distance
they looked back. The crickets had arrived at the intersection
and were dividing into three parties. They
intended to take no chances. Faster than race horses
they ran on and on; they came to a deep chasm, forty
feet wide, and Moawha stopped with a cry of despair.</p>

<p>“Lift her in your arms and jump,” Epworth urged
as Billy also paused. “The crickets are behind us.”</p>

<p>“But—but——”</p>

<p>Epworth lifted Joan, ran back a short distance in
the cave, and running forward with all of his speed,
leaped into the air. He sailed across the chasm like a
bird.</p>

<p>“You can do it,” he called back to Billy. “Remember
that this gravity is twelve times less than the
earth, and that you can do things that you would not
dream of on the earth.”</p>

<p>Billy picked Moawha up in his arms. Her heart was
beating wildly, and with a gentle hand he smoothed
her face. She caught his hand and held it, and he
jumped. For a second his heart was in his mouth, and
then he dropped by the side of Epworth and Joan.</p>

<p>But the chasm did not stop the crickets. It only
served to delay the advance of the Americans, and in
a split second they were again chasing down a long
corridor as fast as they could go. Now, they discovered
that they could outrun the crickets. It was a long
straight-a-way, and they could leap many feet in a
single jump.</p>

<p>They came to another division of the passage, and
Epworth started to take the left hand. Joan stopped
him.</p>

<p>“I may be wrong,” she said, “but I seem to have a
natural orientation that tells me that our planes are
in this direction.”</p>

<p>“All dark holes in the moon look alike to me,” Epworth
responded. “We turn to the right to suit you.”</p>

<p>There was a delay, and they were not far down
this new cavern when they heard the patter of the
crickets behind them. Now the cavern twisted and
turned; now the crickets began to chirp their musical
notes of triumph.</p>

<p>And their hearts went cold.</p>

<p>Joan stumbled, and Epworth stopped to help her.
When he raised her and looked upward he could not
see the roof. Ahead he saw a wide open space. When
he looked to the right he heard a loud chirping of
crickets but could not see them. In other words, in
one direction he could see; in the other he could not.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand that,” he exclaimed aloud.
“Why can I not see to the right?”</p>

<p>“Because on your left there is darkness, and on the
right there is light. The light comes from the great
cricket chamber. We have run around in a half circle
and are coming again to the hive of crickets.”</p>

<p>As Moawha spoke she lifted the head gear from
Epworth’s head.</p>

<p>“I still do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Very simple,” Joan put in impatiently. “You are
wearing——”</p>

<p>“Cavern lights,” Moawha explained. “An invention
of the Taunan pigmies which enables them to travel
through the darkest recesses of the moon. So far my
people have not been able to make them.”</p>

<p>Epworth looked around thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I believe this is where we left our gliders,” he exclaimed
hopefully. “Out toward the center of this
ashy floor.”</p>

<p>“Joy be!” Joan shouted. “Put on your head gear,
and let’s get to them. I am certainly fed up of crickets.”</p>

<p>At this moment there came a warning chirp from
their right. They did not wait to ascertain how near
the crickets were. Bolting forward Epworth lifted
Moawha in his arms and, followed by Joan and Billy,
ran rapidly across the deep ashes. They found their
gliders almost by a miracle. Joan drew the shoulder
straps over her head and shoulders and fastened them
around her waist, and turned to Epworth.</p>

<p>“Let me have Moawha,” she entreated. “Billy will
be too heavy in my plane.”</p>

<p>Without a word Epworth placed the girl in Joan’s
glider, and darted to his own.</p>

<p>“Now, Billy, you and I together.”</p>

<p>While Billy was mounting Epworth’s shoulders,
Joan placed Moawha’s arms around her waist and supported
her on the bar of the bicycle power.</p>

<p>“All ready,” she called in a whisper. “Let us run
together.”</p>

<p>“Circle around in a wide circle until I can find
my second flashlight,” Epworth suggested. “And——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a rush of crickets that began
to swarm around him. But he made no mistake.
Finding an opening he ran forward and jumped into
the air, and began to work his pedals vigorously.</p>

<p>The glider went forward but did not rise. When
he put his feet down to make another start he could
not touch ground.</p>

<p>He had jumped off into a bottomless crater, and
instead of going up, weighted with Billy, he was
going down.</p>

<p>“Julian! Julian!” he heard a faint voice call. “Where
are you? We are falling, falling.”</p>

<p>With a dexterous movement Epworth whirled the
glider in the direction of Joan’s voice. Presently he
saw her, and gave devout thanks for the crater lamps.
True she was red; the plane was red; the whole wide
open space was red; but he could see her.</p>

<p>“The explanation is simple,” he explained as he
drew near her fluttering plane. “Keep the glider on
an even keel; never let it turn over. With the weight
of the girl you cannot fly but you can make a parachute
out of the glider and descend slowly. Take it easy.
That is the best we can do at present.”</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p>He did not tell her that his heart was blue with dark
forebodings; that he believed that they would never
again see the sun or get out of the awful darkness that
encompassed them.</p>

<p>The only hope that he could hold out to himself
was that they were wearing a peculiar head gear that
enabled them to see what was going on around them
notwithstanding the darkness. It was little to build
hope upon but he grasped it, and determined that he
would go down into this strange, terrible world with
as much courage as possible.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXI<br /><br />Crickets Swarming to War</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">On and on, fluttering side by side, the two gliders
descended, circling hour after hour with sufficient
motor power to keep them from tumbling into
a crack up, but continuing steadily downward—slowly
but surely. There was no possible escape. They would
go on downward forever or fall through the moon.</p>

<p>Through the mysterious cavern lamps which Moawha
had taken from the heads of the pigmies who
attacked them in the cave they could see quite plainly
although everything appeared very strange. For a long
time Epworth watched the red planes of Joan’s glider
anxiously but finally ascertaining that she was following
him closely and imitating his movements he turned
to Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, young fellow, give an account of yourself.
We went to the cave to find you and you had disappeared
and taken with you all of our supplies.”</p>

<p>“I disappeared but I did not take the supplies,”
Billy replied. “Some fairy got the supplies. I expect
if you raked his back you would find a cricket.”</p>

<p>And then he told of what had happened to him.
Shortly after Epworth and Joan went to the Aerolite,
while he was standing by his glider working with the
bicycle pedals an army of crickets came out of the rear
of the cave and surrounded him so stealthily that he
did not know they were present until they had made
him a prisoner. They carried him back into the cave,
moved the supplies quickly, and closed up the cave
with heavy boulders. Then they took him on a long
journey through numerous and winding dark caves,
conveying him on the back of two of the crickets bound
hands and feet.</p>

<p>“Boy,” Billy whispered in awe, “that journey was
ghostly. Two large crickets lined up on each side of
me, and believe it or not their backs gave out a phosphorous
glow that lighted up that cavern, and made
the journey easy for my captors. I have been wondering
all this time how it was that two crickets could
give out a glow and the others were black as midnight.”</p>

<p>“Easy, lad. They had rubbed some of that phosphorous
mineral on their backs. A mineral powerful
enough to light up a whole crater miles in circumference
could readily be utilized as a personal light.”</p>

<p>“I’m handing it to you, boy,” Billy exclaimed admiringly.
“You’ve got a brain. I never thought of
that.”</p>

<p>“Go on with your story,” Epworth retorted smiling,
“and do not ask questions.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask a single question,” Billy snorted. “You
butted in with an answer when I was merely stating
a fact. However there is not much more to the story. I
was carried to a large chamber, dumped on the floor
and left. When I was able to look around Moawha was
near me similarly trussed up. My hands being small I
after a time succeeded in working the cords over my
wrists and then cut myself free, and freed Moawha.
So far so good. But it was too good to last. About the
time we were ready to try to sneak out of the chamber
two pigmies entered. I shot at them like a rocket but
could not get to them in time to stop the singing chirp
they sent out calling the crickets to their assistance.
Of course I put up all the fight that was in me, and
Moawha helped quite a bit but they were too much
for us, and again we were bound and lashed until
it was impossible to break loose. In this condition
we were carried to the chamber where you found us,
and shortly after we were thrown on the floor Toplinsky
was brought in. Here we were held prisoners
until you came, our food consisting of dried fruits and
water. Not so bad but Lady Baltimore cake and ham
and—would go mighty fine for a change.”</p>

<p>He glanced ahead, and jammed the rudder quickly.</p>

<p>“Watch where you are going,” he bawled out. “You
came mighty near wrecking us on that sharp extension
of the crater.”</p>

<p>The glider turned abruptly, and dropped rapidly
for several seconds before Epworth could level out.</p>

<p>“What is getting the matter with these things on
my eyes?” Billy demanded petulantly. “It is getting
dark. I can’t see a thing below us, and ten minutes
ago I could see the walls of the crater easily.”</p>

<p>Epworth stared around. It seemed that they had
been suddenly engulfed in a gloom that the night
spectacles would not penetrate. Had their cavern
lamps suddenly grown useless from age, or had they
been broken in some way? It was an annoying interrogation.
To go on, and on, and on, through everlasting
darkness was appalling, fearful, mentally destructive.</p>

<p>“Moawha says remove your cavern lamps,” Joan
called out. “We must be drifting into some kind of
a light.”</p>

<p>When Epworth removed the head gear, and carefully
placed it around his neck so that he could quickly
replace it on his head, he discovered that the walls of
the crater were no longer visible although there was
an eery, mysterious light all around. It was not a
phosphorous glow because there were no rocks or
vegetation to give out such a glow. It was a dim
light of day, and they were falling through space.</p>

<p>When he looked downward he saw no land.</p>

<p>“Heavens,” he muttered, “we have dropped entirely
through the moon, and are we now sailing out into
space?”</p>

<p>They fell a mile before the interrogation was
answered. Then the light grew brighter and they saw
beneath them trees, rivers, green rolling hills.</p>

<p>“Heaven be praised!” Joan cried out with a shout
of joy. “At last we are getting somewhere. It must
be Moawha’s home. She was laughing, chattering,
and cooing to me in an unknown tongue.”</p>

<p>They landed gently on a high hill overlooking a
large valley but the moment she got out of the glider
and looked around, Moawha lost her enthusiasm, and
grasping Joan by the arm ran hurriedly to a dense
thicket of undergrowth to hide.</p>

<p>“Come with us,” she called in a low tone to Epworth
and Billy. “Hide the gliders and then hunt
cover.”</p>

<p>They followed her instructions, and when they
were hidden in the undergrowth, she caught Epworth
by the arm, tiptoed to the edge of the thicket and
pointed down into a part of the valley he had not
seen. His eyes opened wide at what he saw.</p>

<p>Ten thousand pigmy men were marching across the
field in military formation, drilling, shouldering arms,
charging an imaginary foe, and practicing all the arts
of war preparatory to engaging in a sham battle.</p>

<p>“Queen Carza’s soldiers,” Moawha explained
briefly. “If we are captured we will be taken back to
the cricket hive. Carza’s soldiers have succeeded in
gaining a complete mastery over the crickets. They
fight us, kill us, and give our bodies to the crickets
to eat, and they pay the crickets by giving them fruits
and vegetables. For thousands of years they have been
doing this, and when they succeeded in kidnaping
me they probably demoralized my fighting men, and
are now preparing to make a bold attack on them.
With the help of this great giant that came with you
I am fearfully afraid they will make my people slaves,
although there are not more than fifty thousand
pigmies, and there are two million Selinites. With
the crickets to aid them, however, they have a larger
fighting force than we have.”</p>

<p>Without replying Epworth returned to the gliders,
and pushed them deeper beneath the foliage of the
thicket and planted limbs over, and around them.</p>

<p>“First,” he remarked, “we must eat, and then sleep.
Nature can go very little farther.”</p>

<p>They lunched from the supplies left in the gliders,
and then stretched out beneath the undergrowth.
Joan thought she would never sleep again because of
the nervous strain but in this she was mistaken. She
was, in fact, the first to close her eyes.</p>

<p>They were awakened by a loud chirping of crickets
and a whizzing sound in the air. Moawha started to
jump up excitedly but Epworth stopped her.</p>

<p>“No,” he commanded in a low voice, “lie still. We
may be discovered.” Moawha burst out into tears.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Joan asked solicitously.</p>

<p>“The crickets are coming out of the caverns in
swarms to attack my people.”</p>

<p>She pointed upward. When Joan looked up she
saw a black cloud sweeping down from above and
shooting far out over the land.</p>

<p>“They are all armed,” Epworth observed thoughtfully,
“and to——”</p>

<p>“Get to my people we will have to pass through
them, over them or around them,” Moawha finished,
and then added naively: “May I not expect you two
gallant soldiers to aid me in defending my people?”</p>

<p>“You can sure count on me,” Billy asserted quickly.
“I am for you, Moawha, as long as there is life in my
body.”</p>

<p>Epworth grinned, and glanced at Joan. Joan’s eyes
twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly, Moawha, we will help you,” she
replied for Epworth. “To the bitter end but we will
hope that it will be a happy end.”</p>

<p>“If your king will help me my people will win,”
Moawha declared emphatically. “He is a greater man
than the giant.”</p>

<p>She put her hand timidly on Epworth’s shoulder,
and looked into his eyes inquiringly. The young man
turned his head in embarrassment.</p>

<p>“You can count on me,” he replied soberly. “But
when you put me up against Toplinsky you are
making a mistake. He is unquestionably the greatest
scientist, and the most ruthless robber and scoundrel
that ever lived.”</p>

<p>“And that is where Julian has him beat,” Joan put
in. “God is on the side of right, and Julian is
the kind of man who fights always on the side of
right so we are bound to win.”</p>

<p>“G’wan, Joan, you embarrass me. Look upward, and
note what we are up against.”</p>

<p>Another cloud of crickets was shooting across the
sky, and now they could see Toplinsky and Queen
Carza riding in state on the backs of four of the
largest insects.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXII<br /><br />The Wheezing Ramph</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">They traveled as fast as they could, and when tired
they hid in some cave or secret nook. From
Moawha the three Americans learned that the country
she called Taunan was not very large, the population
consisting of about one hundred and fifty thousand
men, women and children. Her country, the Land
of the Selinites, was much larger, and had a population
of three million. It extended from a space on the
south, which was open, and had never been explored,
to another open space on the northeast. It had perpetual
light but Moawha did not know where the
light came from, and had never heard of the sun.
Both open spaces on the south and northeast she
said, were guarded by cricket armies under the direction
of the Taunans.</p>

<p>When Moawha made this explanation Epworth
jumped to the conclusion that he had solved a problem
that bothered the earth astronomers.</p>

<p>“Her country,” he explained to his companions,
“is a long narrow stretch of land, about the size of
Mexico, stretching from Mount Leibnitz at the south
pole to Mount Tycho. The sun shines all the time on
Leibnitz, and I conclude, through a hole in the moon
entirely across the Land of the Selinites, and out of
Mount Tycho, which gives that Mountain its mysterious
bright light. If I understand her correctly the
light does not come in a straight line from the sun,
and they do not see the sun because the edge of the
crater of Leibnitz hides it from view. The Taunans,
however, are so located that they can see the sun and
much of our world.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” Billy put in. “Now let’s get somewhere.”</p>

<p>As he spoke they were crossing a long bridge made
of heavy stones which spanned a deep chasm. At the
beginning of their journey across the Taunan
country they had encircled many cities and had been
forced to avoid many groups of men and women but
now they were going through a country that was
greatly broken by splits in the earth—all of which
were bridged with strong, substantial masonry that exhibited
great masonic skill on the part of the pigmies.
This section of the country was not as populous as
the fertile and alluvial fields of natural vegetation and
luscious fruit, and the further they advanced toward
what Moawha termed the borderland, the rougher the
country became.</p>

<p>In response to Billy’s suggestion they increased their
speed, relaxed their vigilance, and were halfway
across the structure talking in loud voices when they
heard a shout behind them. Curiously they whirled
around. The light was so strong that they had little
difficulty in making out the forms of a hundred or
more pigmies rushing on the bridge behind them.</p>

<p>“Say, Julian,” Billy announced whimsically, “I
haven’t any business on this bridge—none whatever.”</p>

<p>He started on a run for the end of the bridge and
the others joined him. They did not go far. In front
of them bobbed up another small army of pigmies,
and from the side of the structure another horde of
enemies sprang into life out of the shadows that had
obscured them.</p>

<p>“An ambush as sure as life,” Epworth exclaimed.</p>

<p>“And we cannot jump off of the bridge without
jumping into a chasm that goes down probably for
forty miles,” Joan added. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Fight!” Billy responded, making a dive at the
nearest line of pigmies. “Give them all we have.”</p>

<p>Epworth swung his strong arms into action and sent
four of the pigmies head over heels. Joan drew her
automatic and whacked one in the face; four pigmies
caught Moawha, and she screamed. Billy answered the
cry for help by knocking the four pigmies down.</p>

<p>It annoyed them to think that up to this time they
had eluded the inhabitants and had grown so careless
as to permit discovery and an ambush.</p>

<p>With an angry snarl Epworth clenched his teeth
and drove straight into the spears, dropped to a
stooped position, caught two pigmy soldiers by their
legs, whirled them around his head, and clubbed
them back. Then the pigmies closed in on them like
a bed of ants, caught them by their legs, arms, and
waists and began to pull them down.</p>

<p>But at this moment, when capture seemed certain,
the Taunans suddenly released them, sent up a shrill
shout of terror, leaped to their feet, and fled as if
possessed. Taking advantage of this Epworth staggered
to his feet with Billy by his side, and looked around
to ascertain what had caused the flight of their enemies.
What they saw caused them to stop in horror and
Moawha to scream in wild terror.</p>

<p>“A ramph! a ramph!” she cried. “Run!”</p>

<p>She pointed with staring eyes at the side of the
bridge on the north. Along the edge of the structure,
with its head lifted above the railing and its long,
lizard-like body stretched in scaly coils two hundred
feet, was the most terrifying monster they had ever
seen. It had ten legs, and elongated tail, and its movements
were as swift as thought, silent as death and
terrifying; and its three eyes, as large as saucers, glared
vicious red at them in a head fifteen feet wide. But
it was not altogether the appearance of the animal
that frightened them.</p>

<p>In its deep, cavern-like mouth, glowing a phosphorescent
light, was a shouting pigmy, crying loudly
for help.</p>

<p>“Mercy,” Joan cried, “that is the kind of an animal
we fought in the cave.”</p>

<p>“They live in the darkest parts of the caves,”
Moawha gasped, “and never come out unless they
come to eat people.”</p>

<p>Epworth did not wait for a technical description
of the Thing that was as big as four elephants. He had
brought his Police Positive pistol with him from the
glider, and a tear gun. The tear gun being packed
away for future emergency was hard to get but he
jerked his police gun, and began to fire, aiming with
certainty and firing slowly.</p>

<p>The first shot struck the center eye of the monster.
The eye flicked out, and the Thing paused in its efforts
to swallow the pigmy. Again Epworth’s pistol
rang out. This time the bullet crashed into the right
eye. The long, slender tail began to lash the bridge
until it knocked some of the stones from position and
sent them into the chasm. Again Epworth fired. The
last eye was destroyed.</p>

<p>With a wheezing, siren-snarl the monster dropped
the pigmy, lowered its head and began to wave it
around in the air. That it was now blind was patent,
and Epworth pushed his companions back several
feet. The giant body began to fold up, coil, and roll
forward like a rolling snake; its mighty paws went
up into the air, and the front right paw started downward.
Directly beneath the paw the little pigmy that
it had held in its mouth stumbled and fell. If the paw
came down it would certainly crush the pigmy into a
mass.</p>

<p>Swift as an eagle, without counting his own danger,
Epworth bounded forward, caught the pigmy’s clothing
and jerked him backward. He was just in time.
The paw descending struck slightly on the pigmy’s
face and drew the blood.</p>

<p>But the animal now knew not which way to turn.
For several seconds it floundered around, opened and
closed its enormous mouth, and wheezed until the
listeners felt their blood run cold. Finally, still wheezing
it twisted off the bridge and plunged down into
the chasm.</p>

<p>Epworth released the pigmy, and placed him on
his feet. Frightened into a frenzy the little man sped
away.</p>

<p>“Seems to be in a hurry,” Billy observed dryly.</p>

<p>“I can’t blame him,” Joan snorted. “I have a hasty
mind myself. Suppose we travel.”</p>

<p>They gained the end of the bridge but the pigmies
in their rear, regaining their courage, followed. Like
wild men they ran to get away but Moawha was too
slow and Epworth lifted her in his arms. She was heavy
for a pigmy but Epworth managed to keep ahead of
his pursuers. Just ahead of them appeared a long line
of trees. If they could get into the forest there was
a chance of them eluding the little men with their
spears.</p>

<p>With thankful hearts they darted under the trees,
and dashed pantingly into the forest. Their thankfulness
came to an end quickly. The moment they were
beneath the trees an army of pigmies dropped out
of the branches on their heads, their shoulders, their
legs, and before they had time to resist they were
pulled to the ground, and their hands tied behind
their backs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><br />Sons of The Great Selina</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">With grunts of satisfaction the pigmies rose to
their feet, punched them slyly in the ribs with
their sharp-pointed spears, and indicated that they
must get up and march. It was not to be a very long
march.</p>

<p>Hidden away in a deep recess of mountains they
saw a large building constructed with a stupendous
round tube pointing at the sky where the earth was
now shining with soft, refulgent splendor. In front
of the building were many stone steps, arranged artistically,
and forming a long stairway that led upward
to an opening supported by large white pillars, ostentatiously
decorated with painting and signs. Surrounded
by an armed bodyguard they were marched
up these steps, and into a big round chamber.</p>

<p>Their guards marched them up to a large, glittering
disk in the center of the chamber, and stopped. Beyond
the disk were twenty seats; in front of the seats there
was a long, narrow platform. As they came to a stop
the disk in front of them began to whirl. At first it
was noiseless motion; then there came a slight scratching
sound; followed by a voice.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Billy shouted. “A good old American
is talking.”</p>

<p>But when he heard the words his enthusiasm faded.</p>

<p>“This is KFI, Los Angeles, California,” the disk
declared. “We will now hear from Professor Ainslee,
who will talk to us on the condition of the moon.”</p>

<p>The next second, Epworth’s old college classmate
stepped on the disk, looked into the microphone, and
began to talk in a perfectly natural tone.</p>

<p>“They’ve got the old earth skinned a city block,”
Billy asserted in disgust. “Look at that, will you.
They not only hear but they see.”</p>

<p>The disk stopped sharply, Ainslee disappeared. The
disk started again and the City of Los Angeles, silent
and still flashed on the disk. Again it stopped, and for
several seconds they stared at nothing. Then a slight
noise on their left attracted their attention. When they
glanced around twenty pigmies were filing into the
room and seating themselves in the chairs behind the
platform.</p>

<p>They were different in appearance to any they had
yet seen. While the Taunan soldiers had large heads—entirely
too large for their bodies—these men had great
round bulbous balls stuck on stringy necks, and
slender, ghastly bodies, showing that they were of a
different race.</p>

<p>“Sons of the Great Selina,” Moawha whispered in
awe. “They are the smartest and greatest men on our
sphere. It is said that there are only one hundred of
them in their race.”</p>

<p>For some time the twenty bulbous-headed men sat
gazing at the Americans in silence. Their gaze was
penetrating, far-reaching, cutting.</p>

<p>“You are earth men,” the leader finally remarked
in slow, manufactured English. “We saw you coming
in the disk, and placed a trap for you. How did you
get here?”</p>

<p>“We came in a flying machine,” Epworth answered,
determined to put on a bold front in the hope that
they had not heard of Toplinsky and would release
them. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>The pigmy frowned. It was an ugly, dangerous contraction
of a peculiar round face, and it made him
look fiendish.</p>

<p>“We compose the council of Lunar,” he said softly,
his eyebrows stretching across his moon-shaped face
like a rainbow. “We are the brains of this world. We
make the laws, we furnish the thought, we are the
scientists who visualized the great world out in space
and brought its language to our people; we rule
through Carza, our queen, who was taught from
childhood to obey our slightest command. Just as soon
as we capture the Land of the Selinites we shall be
complete rulers of the world.”</p>

<p>“You are quite an honorable and distinguished
body,” Epworth agreed, bowing courteously, “but I
fear that you are not destined to rule this world much
longer.”</p>

<p>The leader glanced at him inquiringly, and when
he saw that Epworth was not making a military move
against him, smiled gently.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that you will have very little to say
about it,” he suggested mildly.</p>

<p>“You need not worry about me,” Epworth added
with another bow. “Just wait until Toplinsky gets his
hooks in.”</p>

<p>“Toplinsky?”</p>

<p>The leader thought over this for some time, and
then consulted his companions. Turning to the
soldiers he issued a sharp command. The soldiers
responded by seizing Epworth, pushing him close to
the leader of the council, and dropping a metal cap
over his head. This cap they connected by wires with
one the leader placed on his own head.</p>

<p>“This little cap,” the councilman explained, “is a
thought transferring device. It will keep you from
lying, and enable me to read all your thoughts. Now
tell me about this Toplinsky.”</p>

<p>“Have you not heard of him? I should think by
this time his connection with your queen would be
known everywhere in your land. Your queen has made
him her king, and together they expect to conquer the
Selinites.”</p>

<p>“I had heard that the queen had taken a consort
but——”</p>

<p>“A great giant, and a scientist of mighty ability. He
is the man who started your world to turning around.”</p>

<p>“Started our world to turn—a man?”</p>

<p>Very calmly Epworth told Toplinsky’s story, permitting
his mind to revert back to the camp in the
Arctic Circle, and the manner in which Toplinsky
had shot water at the moon in a great projectile, and
followed it in fifteen minutes with another projectile
of liquid air to prevent the immediate evaporation of
the water and in order to build up an atmosphere on
the moon. The council leader saw it all flashing
through the American’s brain, and in turn Epworth
saw fear, dread, hate, envy, creep into the bulbous
brain in front of him—a fear that this giant scientist
from the earth would gain supreme control over the
Taunans, and eliminate the council of the Sons of
the Great Selina.</p>

<p>“You have reason to fear him,” Epworth remarked
quickly. “I do not like Toplinsky, I am constantly
at war with him, but I hand it to him as being the
biggest thing in the way of science I ever read about.
In his scheme to make the moon inhabitable he shot
the rarest vegetable and fruit seed from the earth, he
planned a rotation of your little planet that would
give it a Garden of Eden climate, he timed his projectiles
absolutely accurately to prevent the evaporation
of the water he sent up, and he sent nitrates and
fertilizer to assure the growth of his vegetation. When
he was selected by Queen Carza as her consort he
boasted to me that he would soon be the absolute
monarch of this world.”</p>

<p>The councilman removed his head gear, and motioned
to the soldiers to remove the cap over Epworth’s
head. Before this was done however Epworth
saw the thought flash through the pigmy’s brain that
he must do something to rid himself of Toplinsky’s
power.</p>

<p>“You will have to act quickly,” the young American
said slyly. “Toplinsky is a fast worker.”</p>

<p>“What are your intentions?” the pigmy demanded
angrily. “Why are you sneaking around our country?”</p>

<p>Epworth made no effort to disguise the purpose. He
realized that it would be useless with the thought
exposer again on the councilman’s head.</p>

<p>“I intend to keep him from conquering your world.
I am now on the way to help Moawha and her army
keep the crickets out of the Land of the Selinites.”</p>

<p>“Just what can you do against this great scientist?”</p>

<p>The pigmy did not attempt to keep the sarcasm
out of his voice. Epworth shook his head.</p>

<p>“I do not know. I can only hope for the best.”</p>

<p>The cap was removed from the American’s head,
and the councilman leaned forward nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“You are a fool—straight out in the open with your
thoughts, and I doubt if you get anywhere but we
will try to see what your giant friend is doing at this
moment, and then compare notes.”</p>

<p>He stood up, drew aside a curtain, and exposed to
view a bright silvered sheet of metal about four feet
square. In front of this had been placed a peculiar
machine with a projecting orifice connecting with
the sheet with numerous wires made of glittering
copper. With a slight movement of his hand the pigmy
pushed a switch and a cylinder began to revolve inside
of the machine shooting pictures on the silver
square. These pictures were entirely lunar, and
showed houses, land, people.</p>

<p>“By this machine,” the pigmy explained, “we discovered
that you were approaching our retreat. Now
watch for the giant.”</p>

<p>The interior of a large house flashed in front of his
eyes. Thousands of pigmies with large heads and small
bodies were running to and from working industriously.
Among them, towering almost to the roof,
was Toplinsky. On his shoulders, with her copper
legs locked around his neck, was Queen Carza. She
was playing with his coarse red hair and bending
over frequently to caress him with her cheek.</p>

<p>As his figure came prominently into view the giant
stooped and dropped a soft vegetable fabric into a
large vat. Then he called to several pigmies, and instructed
him to follow his example. The pigmies
hung back timidly for a moment, and the queen
shouted at them angrily. They obeyed her quickly.</p>

<p>“She has decided control over them,” Epworth remarked
gently, “and Toplinsky, if I mistake not, has
complete mastery of the queen. When he desires to
be nice that giant can make a post believe he is in love
with it.”</p>

<p>The councilman frowned.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” he admitted. “What is the mighty
giant doing?”</p>

<p>“He is putting a soft vegetable fabric into a vat
full of nitric and sulphuric acid.”</p>

<p>“I can see that, of course. But why?”</p>

<p>“He is making gun cotton—a high explosive that
can be used in the place of gun powder. He contemplates
blowing up Moawha’s people, and all their
cities.”</p>

<p>“With that stuff?”</p>

<p>Toplinsky was removing some of the gun cotton
from the vat at the moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, with that stuff he can blow off the side of a
mountain.”</p>

<p>Epworth spoke quietly but he was greatly excited.
Toplinsky was making rapid strides. It had been only
three days since they had escaped from the crickets,
and during that time the giant had put enough men
to work to make guns and manufacture a goodly supply
of gun cotton and powder. If he expected to aid
Moawha’s people he would have to hurry. And how
could he hurry when he was a prisoner?</p>

<p>The big-headed pigmy shut off the pictures, and
turned soberly to the other members of the council,
speaking to them rapidly in an unknown tongue. As
one man they acquiesced in his conclusions.</p>

<p>“Free them!” the leader commanded, pointing at
Epworth and his companions. “We wish to form an
alliance with you. We have heard that you destroyed
a ramph, and rescued one of our men from his jaws.
That was a kind deed, and I am especially grateful
because the man rescued was my son. But it is not
gratitude that prompts me to this act. We want to see
this man Toplinsky defeated in his purposes. We
would rather leave things as they are than fall into
the power of a mighty monster like this. Hence we
are going to free you, and aid you to get across the
light gap to the Land of the Selinites.”</p>

<p>He led them to a secret corner of the chamber,
pushed aside a large stone, and showed them four
cricket shells.</p>

<p>“Get into them,” he commanded. “They have been
prepared for disguises, and if you use caution they
will hide you from the soldiers. My son, the man you
rescued from the ramph, will guide you.”</p>

<p>The four greatly harassed adventurers obeyed, and
soon four crickets, guided by a pigmy soldier, left the
Observatory of the Sons of the Great Selina, and somewhat
clumsily made their way toward the border land,
avoiding traffic and observation as much as possible.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXIV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><br />Behind a Copper Wall</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">The sun was sending its rays obliquely into the
hole of Taunan when the four disguised crickets,
still guided by the pigmy soldier, passed through a
sleeping camp of crickets composing an army that
was besieging the mountain pass into the Land of the
Selinites. Notwithstanding the fact that the crickets
had out guards well trained, their disguises enabled
them to reach the beginning of a deep ravine that
led up to a stretch of copper wire spread across the
mountain to keep the crickets from getting into the
Land of Selinites. This wire was an inch thick and
meshed in six inches. It extended up into the sky as
far as the eye could reach, and behind it they could
see dimly a vast army of small men armed with copper
axes, bows and arrows, spears and sharp lances. They
were also enclosed in copper armor.</p>

<p>In the past, Moawha informed them, this armor
had proved a great protection in battle but she was
now afraid of the new methods of warfare that Toplinsky
would introduce.</p>

<p>“And well may you be afraid,” Joan said. “But
fortunately there has not yet been a serious attack on
the wall, and if you leave things to Julian I am sure
he will save your people.”</p>

<p>“G’wan,” Billy snorted indignantly. “I haven’t
gone anywhere, and I’m something of a fighter myself.”</p>

<p>Again they discovered that they were talking too
loud. Their guide, when he pointed to the wall, disappeared,
and now, when they heard a chirping sound
behind them, they turned apprehensively. Their fears
were warranted. A band of crickets was entering the
ravine behind them, and hailing them. As they did
not understand the cricket chirpings they decided to
ignore them.</p>

<p>They hopped quickly toward the wall. Their movements
were clumsy, the shells which covered their
backs were heavy, and the sharp eyes of the crickets
discovered that they were not what they represented
themselves to be. A sharp, shrill, terrifying chirp went
out, and the crickets rushed at them in a body, brandishing
their sharp pronged spears.</p>

<p>Putting forth all their efforts they rushed toward
the wall. The crickets pursued, chirping angrily, and
gradually drawing nearer. That they would be overtaken
was obvious.</p>

<p>“Throw off the shells, and run for it,” Epworth
urged. “Hurry.”</p>

<p>He was obeyed, and soon the four were fast-footing
over the uneven ground. They gained some but in
discarding their disguises they lost much of their original
position, and the crickets began to hop dangerously
near.</p>

<p>At this moment curious faces were thrust against
the copper wall on the other side. Moawha shouted at
them in her language. At first they did not answer,
and several crickets hopped in front of her.</p>

<p>Epworth and Billy acted in concert, firing their
pistols. This brought them to a stop.</p>

<p>Shoving Moawha and Joan to the front the two
men defended the rear.</p>

<p>“Call to your friends to open the wall,” Epworth
shouted. “Let them know in as few words as possible
who you are.”</p>

<p>The Selinites heard Moawha’s cries, recognized her,
and with loud shouts of joy, threw open a gate, and
rushed out in a body and drove the crickets back.
Moawha jumped through the wall opening and pulled
Joan with her; Billy and Epworth followed, and the
wall door was slammed and fastened.</p>

<p>With a deep sigh of joy Moawha fell on her knees
and extended her hands, palms open upward. That
she was offering a prayer to God for her deliverance
was obvious, and Billy uncovered his head and stood
reverently by her side.</p>

<p>While Epworth was just as thankful he was a man
of action. His first observation told him that under
the leadership of Toplinsky the crickets and Taunans
would walk through the copper mesh with wire
cutters very easily. The wire, while strong enough to
hurl back the bodies of the crickets, could be readily
cut.</p>

<p>“Come,” he urged. “We have little time to lose. We
must put your borderland in a condition to stand a
siege.”</p>

<p>The Selinites were crowding around Moawha, and
singing songs of joy, quite plainly establishing her
claims to being their lost princess. With an impatient
gesture Epworth caught her hand, and started down
the incline toward the city he saw not five miles distant.
The Selinites objected.</p>

<p>“Inform them that they must obey me implicitly,”
Epworth instructed. “Tell them that there is grave
danger from a new and mysterious source, and that
action cannot be delayed. If they wish to hold a reception
for you it should come later.”</p>

<p>Moawha obeyed, and the American, lifting her
in his strong arms, ran hurriedly down the incline to
the city. Going five miles on the moon, it must be
remembered, is easier than going half a mile on the
earth, and soon they were inside of the city, where
they were met by a large concourse of people who
wanted to take Moawha out of Epworth’s hands. But
still holding her he pushed his way through the assemblage,
and went to a building that looked like a
power house.</p>

<p>His guess was correct, and he deposited Moawha on
the floor and ran to a large coil of copper wire.</p>

<p>“Get busy, Billy,” he insisted anxiously. “This is
an electric plant, and we must use the juice to charge
that copper wire wall, and lay a mine for Toplinsky’s
cricket army. If we can hold them outside for a time—until
we can get our breath—perhaps we will find a
means of pushing them back permanently.”</p>

<p>Billy, who was a splendid electrician, picked up
another coil, attached the wire to a generator, and
began to unroll the wire toward the top of the pass.
The pigmies, crowding into the building, watched
them with annoyance. Who were these white giants
with their queen? What did they mean by short circuiting
the industries of the city? Why were they
meddling with the central electric plant?</p>

<p>A dozen little men came up to Moawha and protested.
Epworth paused in his work to look at them.
They were smaller in size than the Taunans but were
more perfectly built. On their bodies, about the size
of an eight year old boy, were handsomely formed
heads, and pleasant, friendly faces.</p>

<p>“Explain to them that we are going to stop all their
machinery until we can run electric juice into the wall
that protects them from the cricket army.”</p>

<p>The moment the Selinite scientists understood
what the white giants were doing they joined in the
work with enthusiasm, and sent out a call for help.
Soon there were ten thousand small men rolling coils
of wire toward the copper fence between the two
countries. Never before had it entered their minds
that they could make the wall deal death to their
enemies. All they had hoped for was to see them fly
against the mesh and rebound back.</p>

<p>In six hours the copper wall was electrically charged
until its touch meant a shock of death, and Epworth
stopped to sleep. While he was sleeping the Selinites
recrowned Moawha queen. This was necessary because
there was a law in the land that if a ruler was
absent a certain length of time the crown was forfeited.
Moawha had been a prisoner months over
the time but they had loved her so dearly that hoping
against hope they had not elected her successor.</p>

<p>Epworth was awakened by Joan and Moawha, both
of whom were greatly frightened.</p>

<p>“Come,” Moawha pleaded, “they are assaulting our
wall—or rather getting ready to.”</p>

<p>When the young man, accompanied by Billy,
reached the scene, a great army of crickets was rolling
up the mountainside in military formation. Epworth
pushed into the Selinites at a critical moment. The
crickets came within twenty feet of the wall and
stopped. The pigmies, thinking that they were afraid
of their spears and bows and arrows, began to gibe
them.</p>

<p>The answer came before Epworth could give instructions.
It was in the shape of a storm of lead from
the front ranks of the crickets. It was a terrifying
volley. The bullets whistled through the six inch mesh
of copper and the Selinites were badly demoralized
and fled in wild disorder.</p>

<p>Epworth saw the blast of gun fire with passionate
anger. It looked to him like firing cannons at little
children. Nevertheless he shouted and made a desperate
effort to rally the Selinites. But they would not
stop. Never before had they heard the report of a gun
and although the guns being used were small and of
rifle character they had no inclination to stay long
to hear another discharge.</p>

<p>Urged on by their pigmy generals the crickets
charged the wall. In their long feelers, extending from
their mouths were strong wire cutters, and in their
front arms they carried rifles and spears. For the safety
of the Selinites Epworth had turned on the electric
current only to see that it was in working condition
and had turned it off again. Now he gave the signal
to charge the wall.</p>

<p>The signal was answered from the city just as the
first ranks of crickets slammed against the copper wire.
The charge caught them and hurled tons of them
backward against their fellows, who crowded against
them with their wire cutters.</p>

<p>Again Epworth signaled to the city, and the juice
was cut off.</p>

<p>Not understanding this mysterious power flashed
against them a number of Taunan officers approached
the wire wall, and placed their hands on it. Nothing
happened, and with puzzled faces they commanded
another charge. Again Epworth signaled for the juice;
again tons of crickets butted against the wall only
to be hurled back by the invisible force of electricity.</p>

<p>For the second time the pigmy officers investigated
the wall. It still seemed perfectly harmless, and they
mustered up their courage to the point of ordering
another attack. This time they threw an army of
crickets against the wall, pushing the nearest crickets
forward to the danger point with regiment after
regiment.</p>

<p>The force of the movement was so severe that it
bent the wall inward but the electric current still held
them back.</p>

<p>The pigmy leaders now became genuinely alarmed
at the fall of so many crickets, and drew the belligerent
army back sullenly several hundred yards. For a time
they stood in battle array just beyond the reach of
the arrows from the wall, and waited until a messenger
could be sent back inland to Toplinsky.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha,” Toplinsky muttered to himself when he
heard the news, “these Selinites have recently received
some scientific advice on war. I wonder if it is possible
that those two Americans escaped from the caves,
and landed here? If so——”</p>

<p>He clenched his right hand and put his left arm
around Queen Carza’s waist.</p>

<p>“It will not do, my great lord and master,” Carza
whispered to him in an undertone, “to permit the
killing of so many crickets. See they are piled up in
heaps in front of that copper wall. I have led my
people to think that you can defeat the Selinites easily,
and give them the new green world with few fatalities.
They are already mumbling to themselves. There
have been killed——”</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand, I should roughly estimate,”
Toplinsky interrupted abruptly. “They should have
been more careful but I, the great Herman Toplinsky,
will teach these people much. Draw back the army
for a week, and at the end of that time I promise that
there will be something doing. We will go through
that wall as if it were not there.”</p>


<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXV<br /><br />Gunpowder vs. Chlorine Gas</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">When the ranks of crickets dropped back, and
established a great camp within shooting distance
of the copper wall, Epworth was puzzled for a
time to understand the object. Finally he concluded
that Toplinsky was not yet ready to start his heavy
guns to battering down the wall. This meant that the
guns were not made.</p>

<p>“It will give me several days,” he told himself, “in
which to prepare and take an inventory of the war
material on hand.”</p>

<p>“That Toplinsky is hatching something,” Joan said,
coming up from the city and looking over his shoulders
as he was peering through the wall at the encamped
crickets.</p>

<p>“Not at this moment,” Epworth reasoned. “He is
getting ready to blow us out with gun cotton but he
has not fully completed his preparations.”</p>

<p>“Let us drive them away from the wall before he
gets a chance,” Billy suggested. “If we can make them
draw back, or if we can defeat them before he is
ready to shoot we will be on an equal footing.”</p>

<p>“The only way to drive them off is to kill them!”
Epworth replied slowly, “and honestly, I do not like
to do that.”</p>

<p>“They are not human beings,” Joan broke out
snappily. “It will not be any worse than destroying
an ant bed. If these Selinites are to be made happy
they must be rid of this terrible menace.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” Billy declared breathlessly. “Why
not make a lot of gliders, sail out there over the heads
of the fighters and lay them low with tear guns, spear
thrusts, and arrows? True they can shoot a little but I
have an idea that they are not yet sufficient marksmen
to stop an army of men over their heads.”</p>

<p>“Fine idea. Call Moawha.”</p>

<p>Moawha was not far distant, and when Billy called
she came running.</p>

<p>“I want five hundred thousand of your best workmen,
and as many of your bravest soldiers,” Epworth
announced seriously. “I want them quickly and I
want the material that goes into one hundred thousand
gliders—two hundred thousand if we can get
it. Rake your country quickly.”</p>

<p>Moawha did not know what kind of material went
into a glider but when her scientists and expert mechanics
appeared Epworth explained to them what he
wanted, and with the assistance of Billy and Joan,
put a glider together in five hours. When the glider
was finished he sailed it into the air, and explained
its workings, how he pedaled it like a bicycle, and
the detail of manufacture. The pigmies proved very
apt, and the day had not closed before they were turning
the sailing crafts out rapidly. In three days they
had fifty thousand, and were learning to sail them.</p>

<p>While the Selinites were making gliders under the
instructions and guided by Billy, Epworth made a
thorough search in the neighborhood for a large salt
deposit. He found it—a long stretch of waste land
which he reasoned had once been a small sea. With
the help of the Selinite scientists he extracted from
the salt hundreds of tanks of chlorine gas. By working
feverishly he transferred this gas to the fighting front
while he had another body of Selinites making chloroform
guns. They were small and disappointing. When
he first thought of the chlorine gas his heart beat
high with hope but this hope was killed by an inability
to construct a gas projectile that would throw
the gas beyond a point where it would not sweep
back into the face of his own men.</p>

<p>He was not certain but he thought that Toplinsky
was laboring just as rapidly as he was but he was quite
sure that the scientist was working entirely along the
gun powder idea, and finally he developed an idea of
air attack with the chlorine that he was convinced
would put him on a good fighting footing although
it did not promise such effect as bombing with great
airplanes or throwing gas from a swift moving Zeppelin,
or out of a huge cannon.</p>

<p>However he realized that this had narrowed down
to a race between him and Toplinsky, and the moment
he felt that he had a successful weapon he concluded
to open the doors of the border wall and make an
attack on the cricket army.</p>

<p>On the evening of the sixth day he had fifty thousand
gliders and as many chloroform guns ready for
use. By the end of the next day he expected to add ten
thousand more to his equipment. Of course he measured
time by his watch, which he had managed to
keep. With sixty thousand he would make the
attack.</p>

<p>He was seated in a palatial room in the palace of
Queen Moawha taking a brief rest, and talking over
his plans with his three companions when the ground
was shaken by a mighty roar—an explosion that reverberated
throughout the underground world. Epworth
knew instantly what it was but Moawha sprang
up screaming with fear.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” Billy soothed, putting his hand
gently on her arm. “We are still here.”</p>

<p>“W-w-what was it?” she cried hysterically. “Is the
whole world blowing up?”</p>

<p>“It is Toplinsky’s first big gun.”</p>

<p>“Run out to the gliders, and get the men in flying
shape,” Epworth commanded quietly. “I will get the
gunners and have the gas ready. Fortunately we have
fifty thousand of the gliders armed, and the aviators
have some idea of what we intend to do. We must not
waste a second. Toplinsky will batter down that wire
wall in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“B-b-but,” Moawha hesitated.</p>

<p>“You have the only orders that will save your country.
I am going to make for the borderland, and see
if I can keep them from coming in on the women
and children.”</p>

<p>He rushed out of the building, ran hurriedly to
the house where the gun aviators were waiting in case
of a call, and sent them hurriedly to join Billy and
Moawha. Then he got one of the largest gliders,
strapped the planes to his shoulders, and lifted into
the air. As he whirled upward in a great circle another
glider left the earth and came rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>Who was following him without orders? He
frowned. He had set a task for himself. If he was
killed Billy and Moawha could go on with their fight
and possibly win the war. This party who was following
him was getting in the way.</p>

<p>“Why are you trailing me?” he broke out angrily,
slowing up a little in his pedaling. “I gave explicit
orders to——”</p>

<p>“I happen to be an individual who does not take
orders.” He looked around and found his sister, Joan,
grinning at him. “I know that you are flying off at
a tangent for some purpose, and I want to help.”</p>

<p>“Women are always getting in the way,” he ejaculated,
somewhat annoyed. “I am going on a dangerous
task, and you increase the danger.”</p>

<p>“I am no weakling,” she answered sharply. “I am
thrown into a strange world without any friends except
my brother. If he is killed I am left alone. I do
not want to be alone. I am sticking right by your side
until we find a resting spot where we can live without
a constant threat of death.”</p>

<p>They arrived at the summit of the pass. Before them,
huddled together like sheep, were many Selinite
soldiers speeding toward their homes, and throwing
away their arms as they hurried along.</p>

<p>“Hold! Stop!” Epworth shouted from the air. “Do
you want your women and children to fall into the
hands of these flesh-eating crickets? Turn back, and
be men. Help me hold the wall.”</p>

<p>“A demon is belching at us,” one of the men cried
out in broken English. “He is hiding behind an immense
block of rock and with each breath he blows
away our wall.”</p>

<p>“If you are men face the danger. If you are cowards
run away. If you conclude to stay, pause behind this
mountain side and if the crickets come in stay them
if you can until re-enforcements arrive.”</p>

<p>The Selinites stopped, turned around and gathered
up their weapons. Slowly but determinedly they
backed against the mountain Epworth pointed out,
and waited to see if their enemies came in. Here they
were protected from the big guns, and Epworth and
Joan topped the summit and sailed toward the copper
wall. The defenders had departed as one man but
the crickets had made no attempt to enter. They were
waiting orders which were to come later.</p>

<p>Epworth had been bothered during his flight up to
the wall about getting out. He had been rushed to an
extent that he had had little time for the details of
battle, and now he found that there were no Selinites
to open and close the wall gates for the gliders, which
he expected to shove out and start into the air on
the other side.</p>

<p>However there was no necessity to open the gates.
Toplinsky’s big gun, fired only twice, had ripped the
wall in a dozen places, and just as they came up another
discharge rent the air. The gun scattered and
the heavy slugs of rock, which Toplinsky was using
instead of lead, whistled by on all sides. While another
strip of wall fell the explosion only served to
direct Epworth’s gaze to its hidden resting spot.</p>

<p>“I am going to silence that gun,” he called to Joan
in a low voice. “Go back.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” Joan replied bravely. “I am going to
aid you.”</p>

<p>“It is probably manned by Taunans.”</p>

<p>“Unlucky for them. I have my chloroform gun.”</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p>The Taunans and crickets did not see the camouflaged
gliders slip softly out of the border gap, and
sail slowly toward the smoking gun nest. They were
ramming another load into the breech when suddenly
from above them came a stream of greenish
gas. When they looked up a strange bird-like animal
was hanging over their heads, and sprinkling their
faces with some mysterious fluid that smelt——</p>

<p>This was as far as they got in their cogitations.
Under the powerful stroke of chlorine gas they fell on
the ground unconscious, and Epworth dropped silently
by the side of the monstrous cannon. Around
him were scattered numerous cartridges stuffed with
stones and gun cotton, and separating himself from
his glider, with desperate haste he began to tear the
roughly made cartridges to bits. Presently he had a
large pile of gun cotton beneath the breech of the
gun and stretched along the barrel. Then he strapped
on his glider and took to the air, circled slowly around
the gun and dropped a lighted match in the gun
cotton.</p>

<p>It was a reckless act, and he knew it. The second
the match left his hand he whirled his bicycle motor
rapidly and pedaled with all of his strength.</p>

<p>He was lucky. The gun cotton did not blow up
until he was out of the danger zone, and the explosion
destroyed the usefulness of the cannon. With a grim
smile Epworth sailed back to the borderland. He
was just in time to meet an army of planes headed
by Moawha and Billy.</p>

<p>His orders were for the pigmies to fight in pairs.
One soldier, armed with a chlorine gun, was to fly
over a cricket, discharge his gun into his face, and
another Selinite was instructed to lean out of his
glider as he passed over and spear the crickets as they
staggered. The gliders, it is well to state, were made
large enough to carry two of the small Selinites, and
the soldiers were equipped with gas masks.</p>

<p>Epworth had hoped to assault the crickets at a time
when they were not expecting a battle but in this he
was unsuccessful. Toplinsky had already begun the
battle. However, in compliance with his orders when
the gun was put out of commission a horde of Selinite
soldiers rushed up to aid in the defense of the
wall.</p>

<p>The fight began with a clear sky but the explosion
of the heavy gun seemed to shake the air and send
clouds of blackened powder upward, and long before
the gliders were in good action a dark cloud spread
across the sky. This aided the men in the air, and
they sailed over the cricket army with very few fatalities.
Their execution was terrible.</p>

<p>When the gliders reached the end of the cricket
army they sent up rockets, and then darted hither and
yon over the rear ranks shooting chloroform in great
quantities on all sides. Thousands of crickets began to
rush pell mell to and fro. While they were ready to
obey their masters and fight anything on the ground
this mysterious smell that came out of the air above
them from winged birds that did not flap their wings
was something they could not understand, and they
threw down their arms and began to seek safety.</p>

<p>When this movement was completed and Epworth
discovered that they had the crickets frightened he
sent up more orders in the way of rockets which
brought the Selinites in vast numbers charging down
the side of the mountain with chloroform guns and
spears in their hands.</p>

<p>And it was then that Toplinsky awoke to a bedlam
of defeat around him. Everywhere his army was seeking
safety; everywhere crickets were chirping wildly,
demoralized, frightened; rushing over each other and
crushing their pigmy officers. Toplinsky waved his
arms and howled, cursed loudly, and hammered
crickets with his great fists to force them back into
battle; promised them victory, wheeled, fought and
anathematized. But it was all in vain. A swarm of
hopping insects shot by him on their way to the dark
caves of Agrippa.</p>

<p>Presently the giant paused in manhandling his
men, and sniffed the air. At the moment a Selinite
glided by and shot a stream of wet stuff into his face.
He closed his nostrils, and struck a mighty blow at
the Selinite who was trying to gas him from the glider.
Instantly he was surrounded by men, and recognizing
the fact that he had been chloroformed he suppressed
his breath and charged into the Selinites who were
upon him.</p>

<p>Toplinsky was in truth a mighty fighter—a giant of
matchless courage, and single handed he stemmed the
tide of opposition.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho, ho,” he howled like a madman. “That
cursed American! He is smart. How I hate him. Come
out of the air, you coward, and fight like a man.”</p>

<p>Epworth, who was sailing near by, heard him.</p>

<p>“I am here, Toplinsky, and this is final.”</p>

<p>He dropped out of the air by the side of the giant,
releasing his glider. Toplinsky charged with a bellow
like a stuck bull. Epworth side stepped and slammed
a terrific right into the giant’s face, and then a left into
his side.</p>

<p>“Same old tactics,” sneered the scientist, “but you
can’t get me that way.”</p>

<p>He jerked his gun. But he was destined never to
fire. Moawha, with a host of her fighting men swept
between them, and brandished their spears in the
giant’s face.</p>

<p>“Hold!” Epworth shouted loudly. “Do not kill him.
Take him alive. He is the only man who can pilot a
ship back to the earth.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ho, ho, the bantam wishes to return. He
shall not.”</p>

<p>With a laugh like a demon the giant swept the
small figures aside, whirled, and lifting Queen Carza
upon his shoulders, leaped away into the night.</p>

<p>The rout of the crickets was complete. When the
morning came and the clouds rolled away the field
was a shambles and crickets lay gassed in piles. And
Moawha and her soldiers were chasing the crickets in
every direction. Across the arid wastes of Carza’s kingdom,
on to her capital, a handsome city of twenty
thousand inhabitants, and up to the mouth of the
great crater that shot upward out of the inner world
of the moon toward the unknown skies, Moawha’s
soldiers followed the crickets.</p>

<p>But now the crickets were in the air, and when
they came to the Agrippa Crater the little people
were stopped. True they had been able to capture
the entire land of the Taunans, and make prisoners
of the leading military commanders but Carza and
Toplinsky, convoyed by a band of winged crickets,
had deserted the field of action and were flying rapidly
toward the crater. Epworth, Joan and Moawha chased
them to the opening, and stopped. Their gliders, while
strong enough to support them in the inner atmosphere,
were not able to fly up through that dark
forbidding hole.</p>

<p>Toplinsky, although defeated for the moment, discovered
this, and stopped his band of crickets at the
entrance.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, ho! ho!” he shouted in his shrill loud voice
that carried far into the inner world. “For the moment
the American bantam triumphs. But the war has only
begun. Soon I shall come again. The next time my
valiant crickets and brave Taunans shall be armed
with gases and guns that will slay millions. Until that
time——”</p>

<p>Epworth and Moawha saw him wave his hands as if
in high spirits. His action cast a damper over Moawha’s
spirits, and Joan also was troubled.</p>

<p>“W-w-what would you advise?” Moawha asked of
Epworth with much anxiety. “Never before have my
soldiers been this far, and it seems to me if the crickets
pour out of that hole over our heads, armed as that
giant asserts they will be, they can creep upon us when
we are asleep, and totally annihilate my forces.”</p>

<p>“It is a serious problem,” Epworth replied thoughtfully.
“You say that you have a million fighting men?”</p>

<p>“About that number.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to go up into that hole, and clean
out that nest before Toplinsky has time to arm them.
Give him three weeks and he will certainly destroy
your country.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXVI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><br />Writhing, Wriggling Ramphs</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">To prevent Toplinsky from sending a swarm of
crickets out of the crater hole Epworth planted
an army beneath the opening. The soldiers were
armed with the longest range chloroform guns, and
many of them were placed on the mountains that
thrust up their summits near the crater. Then the
young man turned his attention to solving the problem
of seeing in the dark.</p>

<p>Tearing apart the cavern lamps he had hidden
when he left his glider at this place he called in the
brightest of the Selinite scientists and studied the
lamps carefully. Fortunately he had worked with
ofen glass in his aviation work, and now he discovered
that the outer lens of the lamps were made of this
quartz glass, and the scientists informed him that behind
the glass had been placed a coat of rhodamine
dye. Thus an invisible image had been formed by
ultra violet rays, and had been held by the rhodamine
dye in a way that the darkness could not dissolve the
image before it reached the eye.</p>

<p>When this discovery was made and the secret of
the cavern lamps exposed he ordered two hundred
thousand cavern lamps made as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>While he was doing this Toplinsky came down near
the crater opening on the back of a crawling cricket,
discovered the army camped beneath him, and
dropped two large bombs on the Selinites.</p>

<p>“That’s just a reminder,” the giant shouted through
a huge megaphone, “that I am getting busy. In two
weeks—ah, ha! perhaps in two weeks—I shall come
again.” The Selinites shot up at him and his crickets
with their chloroform guns, and were rewarded by a
loud laugh, and then silence.</p>

<p>A terrifying, baffling gloom settled down on the
Selinites. They had won a great victory, they had
chased the crickets out of their country and had captured
the Land of Taunan, and yet they realized that
a man who could drop bombs out of the sky in the
end would defeat them. Epworth, who was also
puzzled deeply over a way to get into the crater, heard
this underground rumbling, and felt his own spirits
dampen. He and his sister, Joan, and Billy, of all the
people in the Lunar world, knew just how dangerous
Toplinsky was.</p>

<p>It was during a period of his deepest gloom that
the leader of the Sons of the Great Selina came out
of his mountain retreat and called on him.</p>

<p>“You wish to go up into the crater?” the councilman
inquired with a sly smile.</p>

<p>Epworth did not like the smile. There seemed to
be hidden treachery behind the smirk. But he was
in a desperate hurry. He felt sure that if given time
he could finally build an airship operated by electricity
with a wire line attached to a power plant constructed
beneath the crater to run an electric motor
on the plane but this could only carry a limited number
of soldiers, and what he had to do must be done
at once. “I certainly do,” he answered abruptly, putting
aside his suspicions.</p>

<p>“It will take courage.”</p>

<p>“I am not boasting of courage,” the young American
said quietly.</p>

<p>“The path leads through a nest of ramphs—many
thousands of the most vicious reptiles known.”</p>

<p>Epworth shuddered. The fights he had had with
this monstrous Thing on the bridge, and inside of
the crater were still fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>“If it is the only way,” he responded.</p>

<p>The councilman of the Great Selina patted him on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Certainly you have courage. It is a pity you are not
a Son of the Great Selina. Perhaps if you clean out
the dangers of this world we may make you an honorary
member. You remember the dark chasm beneath
the bridge that is near the retreat of our order?”</p>

<p>“I should say. I was just thinking of the terrific
battle we had with one of the monsters on that
bridge as you were speaking of them.”</p>

<p>“It came up out of that chasm. Drop down to the
bottom of that chasm, follow it inside of the planet
into a narrow tunnel until you come to the Chamber
of Horrors, clean out the Chamber of Horrors, cross
it and enter another corridor that leads straight ahead
and upward, and if you live you will come to the home
of the crickets.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever make that journey?” Epworth demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“No, I care not to meet those terrifying reptiles.”</p>

<p>“How then do you know that this chasm will lead
me to the crickets?”</p>

<p>“Other Sons of the Great Selina, more hardy than
our present council, made the trip ages ago, and left
records.”</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p>Epworth put himself at the head of an army of two
hundred thousand Selinites armed with chloroform
guns and long sharp steel spears, and with their heads
covered with gas masks, and their eyes aided by cavern
lamps, lowered the soldiers into the chasm on long
ropes, gliders, and various devices of a temporary
character. At a point where the chasm extended into
the earth and the light of day was shut out he stopped
in a narrow defile, and addressed the army briefly.</p>

<p>“We are going into that hole,” he said slowly, instructing
all who could hear to carry his words on to
the rear ranks. “If we come out your country will be
saved. If we do not come out your wives and children
will know that you are dead, and become the slaves
of the crickets and Taunans.”</p>

<p>With this he adjusted his cavern lamp, and darted
forward. The moment he left the light of day and
looked downward he saw that the floor of the cavern
was slightly sandy. Soon he discovered evidence of
gigantic bodies having been dragged through the
sandy soil. Examination disclosed the fact that they
had been made by lizard-shaped ramphs over a hundred
feet long with six feet on each side of their
bodies.</p>

<p>When Epworth and Joan saw the imprint of these
feet cold chills passed down their backs. Very likely
there were thousands of these Things ahead of them,
and every time they thought of the fight they had had
with one of the Things near the cricket home Epworth
shook with fear, and Joan thought that her
mind would be shattered.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they marched bravely into the hole in
the moon.</p>

<p>Onward, climbing steadily upward, hour after hour,
moving like silent shadows in order that their presence
might not be betrayed, the Selinites marched
with Epworth, Joan, Billy, and Queen Moawha at
their head. They traveled with their chloroform guns
in their hands, and their eyes straining ahead, the
way being given additional light by strong electric
flash lights. The danger Epworth was aware would not
have been as great if he had had room to spread out
his army but the corridor was so narrow in places that
he could march his men only a hundred abreast.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p>They had been climbing upward fifteen hours, pushing
earnestly ahead, when they were warned that they
were approaching something by a noisome smell that
came to their nostrils. Joan was the first to get the
scent, and she stopped with a shudder.</p>

<p>“I know now what that smell means,” she whispered
in a frightened voice, “and I can also feel the invisible
movement of the Things ahead. They are preparing
for us.”</p>

<p>The idea that innumerable great and mysterious
monsters were preparing to do battle against them
caused Epworth and Billy to pause also and shoot their
flash lights far ahead.</p>

<p>“There is something uncanny, terrifying, unnatural,
inhuman about the Things,” Epworth answered.
“I feel as if I were going forth to battle with gigantic
spiritual monsters of evil. They move so swiftly, so
silently. They are on you before you know it.”</p>

<p>Billy’s teeth chattered, and Joan trembled violently.
The horrors of that dark underground world
were upon them notwithstanding the fact that they
were backed by a splendid army.</p>

<p>Epworth waited until several hundred soldiers were
around them, and then gave orders to march forward
with all their flash lights hurling flames ahead.</p>

<p>The cavern heretofore had been a long, narrow
corridor. Now it suddenly flared out into an immense
underground chamber, and at the entrance of this
chamber, lying flat and the color of their bodies changing
like variegated lizards to fit into their surroundings,
were twelve round-bodied, scaly backed animals
with polygonal plates covering their heads. They had
their tongues sticking out, and their three red eyes
glared savagely.</p>

<p>“Flash every light into their eyes,” Epworth
shouted. “Blind them.”</p>

<p>Instantly a hundred flashes of steady crimson shot
into the eyes of the ramphs, and their tails began to
lash up and down on the gray floor. Their changing
colors made this motion barely perceptible.</p>

<p>“Now let twenty chloroform guns shoot into their
eyes and nostrils.”</p>

<p>The gas guns were long straight tubes that carried
repeated shots of chloroform, and by the time the
twenty guns had fired one shot each the twelve ramphs
had dropped their heads.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Joan cried. “It works.”</p>

<p>“Advance and use your spears.”</p>

<p>One hundred men rushed forward, and began to
thrust at the doped reptiles. Their thrusts were seemingly
useless, the hard gristle of the lizards turning
the spears easily. For a moment Epworth was nonplussed.
They could chloroform the Things but how
could they kill them?</p>

<p>“Stab them in their eyes!” he commanded sharply,
stepping up to one of the monsters, which
was over a hundred feet long, and jabbing his own
weapon into the monster’s middle eye. “Perhaps that
will get them.”</p>

<p>It did. The animal, stricken, doubled up suddenly,
and lashed downward with its tail then quieted down.
Epworth stepped over its immense leg, and looked
into the chamber. What he saw caused him to draw
back hastily.</p>

<p>He was looking into a large subterranean world
alive with hideous Things. Thousands of them were
slinking back against the floor, changing their color
to suit the rugged rocks around them until they were
almost invisible; others were standing on their rear
feet gazing toward the entrance; others were fastened
to the walls of the chamber with their fierce eyes glaring
fire. The young American felt his blood run cold.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to wipe out this pest hole
with his army of little children—small men who depended
entirely on his leadership?</p>

<p>A little thought convinced him that it was imperative
that they must take the ramphs by surprise. But
the fact that there had been twelve reptiles at the entrance
indicated that there was some sort of a military
organization that knew the value of sentinels.</p>

<p>He glanced again into the chamber. This time
he steeled himself to meet the horror. The monsters,
while many of them had their heads lifted, had not
discovered the presence of enemies.</p>

<p>Fearing that the flash lights might arouse them he
ordered all lights closed, and made an investigation
with his cavern lamps. In front of him the enormous
chamber extended as far as the eye could reach, and
the walls went up to a ceiling he knew was there but
could not see. At the outer edge of his vision he could
make out a pool of black water. The pool and the
chamber were full of writhing, wriggling, monstrous
reptiles. Old lizards, young lizards, male lizards, female
lizards, baby lizards, lizards in all stages of
growth, crawled like ants around the chamber and
into the lake.</p>

<p>A wave of despondency swept over the young man.
A single lizard, crashing into the narrow corridor
where his army was concealed, could wipe it clean
of human life. He must get his men out of the corridor
where they could spread out, and he must do it without
letting the lizards know they were in the chamber.</p>

<p>Quietly, with desperate courage, he placed himself
at the head of his soldiers and gave whispered orders,
and slipped cautiously into the ramph chamber. The
smell was awful, nauseating, sickening, almost death-dealing.</p>

<p>“A Chamber of Horrors, truly!” Joan gasped. “Will
we ever get out?”</p>

<p>However the Selinites moved with such caution that
several hundred soldiers were in the room, and lined
up along the sides of the walls nearest the entrance
before their presence was noticed.</p>

<p>“We must protect the entrance,” Epworth urged.
“The second a lizard starts into it we must get him,
and keep the door open for our companions to come
in. Fire obliquely with your chloroform guns.”</p>

<p>He had hardly ceased speaking when the battle
began.</p>

<p>One who has seen a lizard dart up the trunk of a
tree can form an idea of the incredible swiftness of
these great monsters. Before Epworth was aware a
huge Thing dropped from the ceiling in front of him
with a shrill siren call to its companions. Its eyes were
flaming red; its mouth was foaming; its split tongue,
protruding in evil menacing, twisted to and fro
swiftly. It came with such awful quickness that Epworth
was paralyzed for a second.</p>

<p>Joan saved him.</p>

<p>With remarkable calmness she extended her long
light chloroform tube, and squirted the gas into the
reptile’s snorting nostrils. It sent out a flaming,
overpowering smoke, snorted fearfully, and toppled
over immediately in front of Epworth, who jumped
back hastily against the wall, and thrust his sharp spear
into its eye. Then with a little gasp of horror he
grabbed Joan and dropped down behind the animal’s
body, making it a fortress against another attack. Thus
protected the two began to use their dope guns with
deadly effect. Their example was followed by the
soldiers under their command.</p>

<p>In the meantime Billy and Moawha, who were
leading the attack on the opposite side of the entrance,
were having an experience very similar, although
Billy dropped the first reptile quicker than Epworth
had done, and protected his men with greater ease.</p>

<p>In a short time the lizards were piled up around
the entrance for several hundred yards, and were
climbing over each other in a vain attempt to get to
the soldiers. This enabled the Selinites to run out of
the narrow corridor and join their companions, thus
pushing the tide of battle back on the lizards, and
piling them high around. While many of the Selinites
were hurt, in two hours the entire army was inside of
the Chamber of Horrors, and the battle was won.</p>

<p>Soon the great chamber was full of chlorine gas,
and the ramphs were choking, snorting, snapping
death (without knowing where it came from) while
the Selinites were protected by their gas masks. Now
Epworth commanded a company of soldiers to circle
around the place, find the tunnel on the other side
that led to the Cricket World, and bar it up with
stones in order to keep the gas inside of the ramph
chamber.</p>

<p>When this was accomplished the reptiles were driven
from the walls and floors into the lake of black water.
This lake, Epworth found out, was several miles long
and over a mile wide but the water was shallow, and
proved of little aid to the lizards. When the reptiles
stuck their heads under the water they gained some
respite but not understanding what was troubling
them they lifted their heads immediately, again to be
caught by the breath of chloroform. Then they sank
never to rise.</p>

<p>When the dope had cleaned them out, the Selinites
calmly plunged their spears into their eyes.</p>

<p>At the end of a day’s hard fighting the work was
done. Not a single ramph was left to start another race
of monsters, and Epworth, opening the tunnel on the
opposite side, led his soldiers out of the terrifying
place, and sealed it up again in order that the fumes
should be confined to the area occupied by the lizards.</p>

<p>Then, after a long rest, he turned his face toward
that nightmare of horror—the home of the crickets.
Here he expected to meet Toplinsky armed with gun
cotton, huge guns, and powerful explosives, an intelligent
man leading a multiple host of soulless insects—insects
that ate flesh of all kinds of men and animals.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXVII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><br />Carza’s Use of Lava Streams</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">While he was backed by an army of Selinites,
Epworth felt as he came to a halt in front of
a crude stone wall as if the lives of thousands of little
children were in his hands. Under his leadership these
little men could be brave and victorious. Without
him he imagined that they would melt like snow before
the onrush of the crickets, and the vicious Taunan
dwarfs. To protect them he concluded to go ahead and
reconnoiter.</p>

<p>He recognized the corridor. It was the place where
he and Joan had had their first encounter with a
ramph. He shivered again as he thought of the uncanny
feeling that had swept over him at the time.</p>

<p>They discovered that the wall which blocked their
way was of recent construction, and that it cut them
off from the Lava Chamber. When they attempted to
remove the heavy stones they proved burdensome although
no attempt had been made to cement the stones
into position.</p>

<p>Finally Epworth and Joan removed their gas masks
and cavern lamps, and thrust their heads through
the new-made hole in the wall. As they expected they
found that the little stream of spluttering, moving
fire sent out a dim light that created ghostly shadows,
and dark spots, deepened by the fact that their eyes
were not accustomed to any light except that given
by the photographing of dark images on the ofen
glass and rhodamine dye by the cavern lamps.</p>

<p>The chamber appeared empty, and Epworth
stepped through the wall into the chamber.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said to Joan, “everything seems all
right.”</p>

<p>Joan obeyed quickly, and the two turned to step
across the chamber toward the lava stream. As they
moved away Billy and Moawha, who had been aiding
them in removing the loose stones, ran back to join
the Selinite army. This left the man and girl alone to
spy out the situation.</p>

<p>“Ah, come in lads! Sure everything is all right,” a
shrill voice called out. “Most assuredly the goose
hangs high. Throw up your hands!”</p>

<p>The last command was jerked out viciously.</p>

<p>Epworth rubbed his eyes and glanced in the direction
of the voice. He did not need to be told that the
speaker was Toplinsky. The giant was standing behind
the divan on which he first saw Moawha, and
had a long rifle pointed at his heart. Near Toplinsky
were Queen Carza, and six Taunans, all of whom were
covering him with guns.</p>

<p>The young American dropped to his knees and
plunged forward like a football player. Joan stood
still, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>Toplinsky and the Taunans fired but their bullets
went wild. Before they could shoot again Epworth
was on the giant. But the divan was in the way, and
he was forced to stand up, and drive at Toplinsky’s
face with his clenched hand. With a howl of rage the
giant threw his immense arms around the young man
and pinioned him as he was struck.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! I have you at last. In these great arms I
hold you. You are my meat.” Toplinsky grinned to
himself as he thought of the trap he had laid for these
spies when he heard the noise of the stones being removed.
“I shall delight in squeezing you to death.”</p>

<p>“Not so, my dear,” Queen Carza put in sweetly.
“This earth man has given us much trouble, and he
has sneaked in here for no gentle purpose. We must
discover his purpose. Let me deal with him.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, my little one. Ho, soldiers! Tie
him up tight.”</p>

<p>The command was obeyed quickly, Epworth’s hands
and feet being laced together.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” Carza inquired slyly,
shoving her thumb viciously into Joan’s ribs. “Where
did you come from? We know that that passage leads
to the ramph chamber, and you must have found
some other way to get in. Tell us about it, my little
dear.” Her voice was soft but menacing.</p>

<p>She pinched Joan wickedly, and the girl shrank
from her.</p>

<p>“The man will tell,” Toplinsky broke in anxiously.
“The girl——”</p>

<p>“Is nothing to you,” Queen Carza interrupted
brittlely. “And I do not like her.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky did not reply. Stooping down he removed
Epworth’s sandals, and pushed up the pants
until his knees were exposed. Queen Carza, noting
the soft white skin, rubbed his leg gently.</p>

<p>“Nice. Soft. White.” She spoke very pleasantly.
“Almost as soft——”</p>

<p>She removed Joan’s stockings, and pointed at the
stream of lava.</p>

<p>“Why the girl?” Toplinsky protested. “We are not
making war on women.”</p>

<p>This remark astonished Epworth. He was of the
opinion that Toplinsky would not hesitate to war on
a child.</p>

<p>“The man may let us burn his legs but he will
not permit the delicate coloring of his sister’s legs to
be changed by harsh measures.”</p>

<p>Toplinsky shuddered. He really had no intention
of burning Epworth’s legs. His act was a bluff in the
hope of getting the American to speak up.</p>

<p>“Yes we will begin with the man.” The queen
kneeled down by the side of the American and smilingly
stroked his leg. “But think not of the woman
kindly. It is not likely that she will ever leave this
chamber, so you had best forget her.”</p>

<p>“She came with me against my will,” Epworth asserted.
“I am the one who holds the scheme under
his hat, and you two are not going to discover it.”</p>

<p>“Tush, tush, my friend,” Toplinsky sneered. “That
is too bad.”</p>

<p>“Nice white legs that will burn quickly.” Queen
Carza pulled Epworth slowly toward the lava fire. He
was surprised at the strength she displayed. She
stopped before she got to the stream of lava but when
she placed his bare legs on the stone floor he discovered
that it was scorching hot.</p>

<p>“Not too hot but comfortably nice,” Carza observed
with an interested stare, and added brightly, “did I
understand that you wanted to talk?”</p>

<p>Epworth thought of the Selinite soldiers hidden in
that narrow passage just beyond the pile of loose
boulders. If Toplinsky discovered that they were there
he could roll into the lava chamber one of his big
guns and clean the passage of every vestige of life. The
Selinites could neither retreat or advance. Inwardly
he cursed the evil ramph corridor but outwardly he
was calm and even-tempered. He shook his head
quietly and looked at Joan.</p>

<p>Joan understood him, and he saw her clench her
teeth. It broke his heart to think of the torture that
would come to her but he was now convinced that
Toplinsky would never know that his foes were getting
ready to spring out of the darkness upon him.</p>

<p>“No, he does not wish to talk, and he has such a
long tongue, and it can wag so swiftly at times. Perhaps
the lady would like to talk for him?”</p>

<p>Carza shoved Epworth up to the edge of the lava
stream, and permitted his legs to hang over the spluttering
fires. At the same time she looked inquiringly
at Joan. Joan shook her head dumbly. She would
gladly give her life to save Epworth from torment but
this had now become a question of honor.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>Carza waved her hand. Instantly her Taunan
soldiers sprang forward, and dragged Joan up to the
stream of lava. The sweat of torture began to pour
from the faces of Epworth and Joan.</p>

<p>“No, stop it!”</p>

<p>Toplinsky leaped across the chamber and dragged
Joan from the fire.</p>

<p>“Ah, so you want her. You think that you will keep
her, and when you get control of the world you will
throw me down and make her your queen. I have
feared it.”</p>

<p>“Honestly, I never thought of it that way,” Toplinsky
replied abashed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXVIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><br />In the Armory</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Carza stamped her foot with imperial authority.
The Taunans grasped Joan and lifted her in
their arms.</p>

<p>“Hold! Drop the girl.”</p>

<p>Billy and Moawha, both of whom had grown anxious
over the prolonged absence of Epworth and Joan,
thrust their faces through the hole in the wall. The
second Billy saw his friend he understood the situation,
and shouted loudly. But he was not satisfied with
calling out.</p>

<p>Thrusting his chloroform gun through the wall he
sprayed the six Taunans who were carrying Joan
toward the fire. The chloroform stupified them instantly,
and Joan fell to the floor. Immediately Billy,
Moawha and many Selinite soldiers crowded into the
chamber. Moawha and her soldiers used their guns
on the dwarfs and while they were doing this Billy
rushed to the aid of Joan and Epworth. Slashing the
cords that held them he grabbed some gas masks from
two of the Selinite soldiers and brought them down
over Epworth’s and Joan’s heads.</p>

<p>This was an infinite relief to Epworth and Joan.
Already they were feeling the effects of the chlorine,
and as soon as they experienced the relief they sprang
to their feet, and shot their eyes around in search of
Toplinsky and Queen Carza. They were in time to
see the two leaders dashing toward an open door.</p>

<p>“This way!” Epworth called out hurriedly. “Toplinsky
and the queen are rushing to organize the
crickets. We must beat them to it.”</p>

<p>Followed by Joan and many Selinite soldiers Epworth
pursued Toplinsky and the queen. As they
passed corridor after corridor of caves Queen Carza
sent out her chirping warning to the crickets.</p>

<p>While Epworth and Joan chased anxiously after
Toplinsky, Billy and Moawha stopped many of the
Selinite soldiers, and began to pour chloroform at
the insects. But not all of the soldiers followed them.
Several thousand rushed after Epworth and Joan.</p>

<p>Suddenly Toplinsky and the queen, who had been
dimly visible down the corridor, disappeared. When
Epworth and Joan arrived at the point where they
had disappeared they found themselves looking down
a long incline into an immense chamber. The moment
he saw this chamber Epworth realized that he was
looking at the magazine and armory that Toplinsky
had prepared for the crickets. The space was teeming
with crickets, multiplied thousands of them. Toplinsky
was standing on a keg of powder bellowing commands,
which were translated to the crickets by the
queen in the chirping voice of the crickets.</p>

<p>As Epworth stopped he looked behind him, and
discovered that he was followed by Selinite soldiers
ready to attack the crickets. Already Toplinsky was
forming gun troops to shoot heavy cannon balls down
the corridor he was standing in. If Toplinsky could
get his big guns into operation he would annihilate
the small army of Selinites in the corridor.</p>

<p>Epworth was worried. What should he do? His entire
scheme of surprise had fallen flat before he could
get his chloroform guns battering at the center of
the cricket population.</p>

<p>A blundering cricket solved his problem for him.
A dwarf was explaining to the cricket the method of
firing a cannon with a torch. The cricket fumbled the
torch, and the flame fell on a powder fuse.</p>

<p>The fuse was Toplinsky’s fatal mistake.</p>

<p>He had placed it and connected it with all of the
powder and explosives he had made with the intention
of trapping invaders in the armory, and blowing
them up. It was a good idea of defense properly
managed.</p>

<p>Now the torch fired the fuse, and the blaze spluttered
along toward the great magazine like a swiftly
crawling snake. Toplinsky saw it, and dashed recklessly
at the fuse to stamp it out. He did not pause to
lower the queen, who was sitting on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He ran like the wind. Swiftly spluttered the fuse.
Great beads of sweat slipped out of the giant’s face.
It was a race with death.</p>

<p>Faster and faster raced the fuse. Toplinsky, in his
hurry, forgot the gravity of the moon. He lifted his
foot as if running in an Olympic meet. The act caused
him to topple over although it carried him nearer the
goal. Staggering to his feet, with the queen still clinging
to his shoulders, he made another attempt.</p>

<p>Now the spluttering fire was almost to the magazine.
Epworth shuddered and jerked Joan back. If Toplinsky
failed——</p>

<p>The giant was almost on the fuse; he lifted his foot
upward to stamp out the fire. Again in his excitement
he overlooked the moon’s light gravity. His foot came
down on the opposite side of the spluttering fire.</p>

<p>There came a terrific explosion. It sounded like an
inside volcano blowing off the top of the moon.</p>

<p>Epworth and Joan were lucky. They were standing
in a corridor Toplinsky had set apart as a safety valve
for the men who fired the fuse if commanded. Crouching
down they saw the interior of the tremendous
cavern shoot upward. Then rocks and debris began
to fall with loud crashes.</p>

<p>The sides and roof of the cavern had caved in, and
the debris was showering down like falling snow.</p>

<p>The vast horde of crickets that had been rushing
around arming themselves and pushing guns forward
to drive out the Selinites disappeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>Toplinsky, their scientific leader, had brought annihilation
to himself and his whole colony of crickets
by his shrewd attempts to slay others.</p>

<p>The living remnants of crickets, hidden in their
secret nests, were hunted down by the Selinite soldiers,
who rooted them out forever.</p>

<p>Moawha, kind-hearted and troubled, granted amnesty
to the Taunan dwarfs when they pledged allegiance
to the Selinite nation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXIX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><br />Out of the Depths</h2>
</div>

<p class="first">Epworth, Joan, and Billy soon grew weary of life
with the Selinites. They were banqueted, honored
in every way possible, and assured constantly of
the gratitude and friendship of Moawha and her
people. But the people were little, the houses were
small, life was narrowed to investigations of the interior
of the moon, and what they could learn from
the Selinite scientists.</p>

<p>In addition to this Epworth felt that it was his duty
to go back to the Aerolite, and give aid to the colonists.
They had made him co-leader with Toplinsky; and
they expected him to give them the best advice and
help he could. It entered his mind that he could
bring them down into the interior of the moon where
they could live with greater ease.</p>

<p>But when he spoke of this to Moawha she demurred.
She had heard about the colonists from Joan,
and she was not impressed with the idea of turning
a lot of robbers and bad men loose among her people.</p>

<p>“At first, under your control, they might behave
themselves,” she said, “but if you were to die they
might decide to run wild, and annoy my people.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Epworth admitted reluctantly. “I
am not bragging about their religious background.”</p>

<p>“Even if I agreed, there comes the question of getting
them here. How would you manage that? How
will you go back to them?”</p>

<p>“We might take them back to the earth,” Billy
suggested.</p>

<p>“That is another problem with Toplinsky dead.
Just the same I am going to see just how easy it will
be for us to fly up to the outer crust through Crater
Agrippa.”</p>

<p>“When you make the attempt I go with you,” said
the loyal Joan.</p>

<p>“Count me in it,” Billy added.</p>

<p>“Very well; we are on our way.”</p>

<p>To accomplish the ascending flight Epworth made
three large motor-gliders. Well supplied with provisions
for the trip, the three hardy Americans, accompanied
by Moawha, made their way to the spot
where the hole of the crater opened out from the
inner world of the moon. It was a great frowning,
black hole but the hardy adventurers did not let the
looks of the route affect them. They bade Moawha a
pleasant farewell, climbed into their gliders, and
began to pedal around in a circle. In this manner
they soon left the land of the Selinites, the light of day,
and climbed up into the darkness with their flashlights
in hand and their cavern lanterns fastened to
their heads.</p>

<p>The upward trip was uneventful until Epworth
suddenly found himself flying near a roof of large
boulders and rocks which had not been there when
they came down from the cricket nest. When he was
joined by Joan and Billy all three flew around in a
circle looking for an opening that would lead them
upward.</p>

<p>They could find no way to go out.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” Billy inquired in great
alarm when they discovered that their way out was
blocked. “All these rocks were not here when we came
down.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if that terrific explosion that
Toplinsky set off has caused the insides of the crater
to fall in and block all passage upward,” Epworth
reasoned. “We are probably in a part of the crater
which was narrow, and when the big boulders fell
they crashed together.”</p>

<p>“That means that we are not going out,” Joan observed
very quietly. She was very anxious to get out
and try to get back to the earth. Of the three she was
the one who had little interest in the inside of the
moon. “I—I—had been building up great hopes.”</p>

<p>Epworth made a thorough examination of the rocks
and debris that blocked the way.</p>

<p>“We are not going out this way,” he said, shaking
his head sadly. “It looks as if we are doomed to become
Selinites.”</p>

<p>“Moawha and her people are very charming,” Joan
added thoughtfully, “but they are not our kind of
people. They like us now but the Selinites may take
a notion to change rulers over night. If they did we
might not be so popular.”</p>

<p>“The light in the Land of the Selinites is steady,
constant, and never lets up,” Billy put in. “You have
explained that to me with the statement that the sun
shines all the time through an open space in Mount
Leibnitz. That means that there is an outer opening
in that mountain. Why not try going out that way?”</p>

<p>“Billy, you are a scholar and a statesman,” Epworth
declared enthusiastically. “We will do that very
thing.”</p>

<p>They returned to Moawha’s city, and explained
to her why they could not go on to the outer portion
of the moon. When they told her that they were going
to try to go out through the hole in Mount Leibnitz
she immediately informed them that she would go
with them as far as Mount Leibnitz.</p>

<p>Moawha had spent her entire life in the Land of
the Selinites, and the idea that there was a great ball
of fire out in space and shining through the outer rim
of the moon was new and strange to her.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that there is such a fire,” she exclaimed.
“If there is I want to see it.”</p>

<p>Again Epworth, Joan and Billy, accompanied by
Moawha, made a journey with a view of gaining the
exterior. It was not a hard trip. All four had motor-gliders,
and were able to fly easily over the rugged
hills and interior projections of the moon which stuck
up like small mountains.</p>

<p>But as they approached the great Mount Leibnitz
the air grew warmer and warmer. Presently it became
intensely hot, and even when they faced this heat they
did not get a view of the sun. It was the steady flame
of sunlight reflected against the rugged interior near
the south pole that created the heat.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Epworth insisted on pressing onward.
Finally they came to a mountain that ran up into a
sharp peak. This mountain reflected many and varied
coruscations, indicating that it was a large heap of
colored stones. The heat here was almost unbearable
but Epworth persisted in his advance until the three
stood on a high peak with a blazing light all around
them. Epworth was the first one to climb to the top
of this peak.</p>

<p>“There, Moawha, is the mass of fire that makes
the light and heat for your world.”</p>

<p>He turned, and lifted the little queen in his arms.
What she saw caused her to cover her eyes with her
hands and scream.</p>

<p>A great ball of blazing fire, bigger than anything
Epworth had ever seen, shot down at them from out
of the sky. Its heat was scorching, burning, blistering.
Just a few moments under that blazing glare, and their
clothing would be scorched, their flesh would be a
mass of blisters, and they would fall down never
to rise, yet this was their only way out!</p>

<p>“We can’t go out here,” Joan remarked quietly, as
she pulled her brother back so that he was protected
from the blazing sun by the top of the mountain.
“This is just the beginning. There may be miles and
miles of heated interior before we can get out of the
hole to outer space.”</p>

<p>“Then we will have the same heat until we get to
a point where the movements of the moon bring
about the fourteen days of night.” Billy’s voice was
mournful. “It looks to me that we are inside of the
moon for keeps.”</p>

<p>Epworth led them down the mountain side to a
spot where they were given the shadows of the hill in
a way that brought a little relief from the terrible
blaze. When he stopped he glanced at Joan’s hat. It
was a combination of light straw and cloth, held away
from her head by four slender slits of leather in such
a way that the air percolated through her hair.</p>

<p>Taking the hat in his hand he studied it for several
moments.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” he said quietly. “Let’s go back
to the Land of the Selinites, and work it out.”</p>

<p>Blindly his companions followed him, and for two
weeks Epworth worked with the best scientists of the
Land.</p>

<p>The result of this labor was the construction of
three hollow body-helmets of asbestos, held away from
the skin of the body so that air could percolate between
the asbestos and their bodies. Air helmets for
their heads were also made of asbestos. In addition
to this, they covered their gliders with asbestos. Over
all Epworth spread a coat of aluminum.</p>

<p>Thus prepared they flew again to the South Pole.
Moawha went with them.</p>

<p>“I am not going to let my good friends leave me as
long as I can see them,” she assured them. “Maybe you
will have to come back again. I hope so. But if you do
not you shall know that Moawha loves you, and wants
you with her.”</p>

<p>It was a solemn parting. They left Moawha standing
on the shady side of Mount Leibnitz’ peak waving
her hand at them, and crying softly.</p>

<p>All three sprang into the air at the same time. Epworth
jockeyed his glider near to Joan, and pointed
upward. Upward meant straight into a blazing sun
without any signs of land around them until they
passed out of the crater.</p>

<p>“That for the heat!” shouted Billy when he got up
into the glare of the sun, and discovered that the improvised
protection would in a way answer the purpose.
“I can stand a little heat.”</p>

<p>But he had no idea of the heat he would have to
stand. Soon he discovered that he had spoken joyfully
too soon.</p>

<p>It was an endless fiery furnace. Hour after hour
they circled upward and outward. The hole in Mount
Leibnitz proved of enormous size; the heat was greater
than any they had ever encountered.</p>

<p>Fortunately Epworth had brought his binoculars
with him, and using these, and his natural orientation,
he was able to keep near the western line of the crater
and know when they had left the inner part of the
moon and had gained the outer portion.</p>

<p>Then began another long, wearisome journey,
traveling over the surface of the moon without a compass.
Putting the sun to their backs the three flew on,
and on and on. But to give all the details of that
terrible trip through blinding, blazing heat would
necessitate a volume. They found some diminution
in the heat after leaving the crater of Mount Leibnitz.
Had it not been so they would never have accomplished
their journey.</p>

<p>But finally they got to the Sea of Vapours and the
lake that Toplinsky had made. Here they met with
a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Epworth and Billy were of the opinion that they
would experience much trouble in learning to operate
the Aerolite. The nearer they got to the Rocket
ship the more depressed they became because of this
idea.</p>

<p>But when they landed near the Aerolite they were
met by Michael Strauss. He greeted them joyfully.</p>

<p>“You are just in time,” he said, shaking their hands
heartily. “I have been digging into Toplinsky’s desk.
The giant left hidden there some blue prints of the
Aerolite, and instructions about controlling it, and
directing its course. These instructions are simple to
a navigator and mechanic, and now that Toplinsky
is dead I will undertake to guide the Rocket back to
the earth.”</p>

<p>Gladly Epworth placed the matter in Michael’s
hands after he had read the instructions, and under
Michael’s skillful navigation the trip was made safely.</p>

<p>Naturally Toplinsky’s moon colonization scheme
fell through but Epworth gave the colonists time to
disappear from the Arctic camp, and then he and Joan
and Billy found their way back to America, and sent
government planes to recover the loot Toplinsky had
stolen.</p>

<p>But one mystery always remained to trouble the
astronomers. What had made the dark spot near the
corner of the Sea of Vapours, and why did it gradually
vanish?</p>
